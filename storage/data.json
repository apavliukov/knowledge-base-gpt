Today we continue our journey along the mountains of Arcadia to the wild nature of the Mani region. Starting we do so in a region that is often skipped by tourists, but has a very special place in my heart because it was the subject of my thesis: Arkadia. Arkadia To continue our journey from Nafplio to the ruins of Sparta, we have to drive south through the immensely beautiful region in the central Peloponnese. What follows is a drive through an endless series of mountains and immediately a good stopping point for those who like to get out and about. The fact that remnants of Greek cities can also be spotted here and there in these mountains makes this region a dream combination for the more active historian who is not averse to stepping off the beaten track. Megalopolis and Tegea: the tiny remains of two mighty Greek cities This landscape has hardly changed in the last two thousand years, and already in ancient times the region was known for its high mountains, which on the one hand made contacts between the various Arkadian city-states difficult but on the other enabled them to actively resist the threat of Sparta. Since the power of the Spartans certainly posed a great threat to the Greeks living near the city, the Arkadian poleis, such as ancient Tegea, decided to unite in the Arkadian Koinon. This was a loose organisation or federation in which the members decided to unite in certain areas: they had a standing army and its members, the myrioi met several times a year in Megalopolis, a city that the members of the Koinon founded together around 370 BC. During the fourth century BC, the Koinon disintegrated and the poleis of Arkadia, outside Megalopolis, became less and less important in general Greek history. Today, traces of both Tegea and Megalopolis can still be found. Although today Tegea is little more than a village, it does have an impressive and state-of-the-art museum that gives a very good overview of the region’s history. You can also see the remains of the sanctuary of Athena Alea, one of the most important temples to the goddess in Greece. In this Doric temple, people in ancient times could ask for asylum and save themselves from dire situations by seeking refuge in the temple. Megalopolis is home to the largest theater in the Peloponnese, larger than the famous one at Epidauros, with seats for some 21,000 spectators. As we have already learnt, this city was founded by the other Arkadians around 370 B.C. as the ultimate anti-Spartan stronghold and continued to play a major role in the affairs of the peninsula until it became part of the Roman empire after 146 B.C. Besides the theater and the Thersilion, a building with a very interesting layout whose exact function we do not know, a very long stoa dedicated to Philip II of Macedonia, a temple to Zeus and a whole series of public buildings have also been found. Lakonia From Megaolopolis, we move on to the Taygetus Mountains, which brings us to the region around one of Greece’s most famous cities, Sparta. Of course, any road trip around the Peloponnese is not complete without a small stop in the city, and today you can still see some remnants of the once glorious Greek city with a stunning view of the surrounding mountain ranges, just outside the centre of modern Sparta. In Sparta today, you can still find traces of a 5th-century BCE Greek theatre near the ancient Agora from the 4th or 3rd century BCE. The site was probably also still in use in the Byzantine period as traces of Byzantine houses have been found. There is also the Archaic Stoa and the so-called ’round’ building. This building was essentially built around a low natural hill and what probably dates from the 7th or 6th century BC. Again, the exact function of the structure is not known, but suggestions were Epimenides’ circular building with statues of Zeus and Aphrodite Olympia or the Skias, a building for public and musical performances. In addition, Sparta is also home to several sanctuaries such as the one for Athena Chalkioikos and the temple to Artemis Ourania, but you can read more about these in a forthcoming guest post! Mystras: a Byzantine city Just outside the city of Sparta, you can find the Byzantine city of Mystras. After the fourth crusade, the Peloponnese was occupied by the Franks, who built a castle on Mount Mizithras in 1249. From 1262, Mystras became an important settlement for the Byzantines, who had taken control of the peninsula. Throughout time, the city flourished and more and more people settled in the mountains. From 1348, Mystras became the capital of the Despotate of Morea, an independent principality in where the despot appointed by the Byzantine emperor was the supreme ruler. Even when Mystras fell to the Ottomans in 1460, the city continued to grow in stature and was an important trading centre of the Mediterranean. From the 17th century, the city came under varying control of the Ottomans and Venetians, and in 1770 the city was destroyed by Albanian Muslims after which most of the inhabitants left. Mystras has many noteworthy sights and has been showing off on the Unesco World Heritage List for years. Besides the impressive churches like the Agia Sofia with their beautiful Byzantine mosaics, the view from castle inside the Acropolis is definitely worth climbing up the mountain. Another important building from the Byzantine period is the Pantanassa, a monastery founded in 1428 and the only building in Mystras that is still inhabited. Today, the oldest church in Mystras, dedicated to Agios Dimitrios, houses the Museum of Mystras with a comprehensive overview of the city’s history. The Mani Peninsula We end this part of our trip in the slightly more rugged region in the very south of the Peloponnese, the Mani Peninsula. Although the mountains in Arkadia already seem high and endless, it is nothing compared to the landscape that stretches across the middle of the three peninsulas. The region’s capital is Aeropoli, the city of Ares, and is also the ideal base to explore the other villages, many of which could only be reached by boat well into the 20th century. Despite the harsh climate, traces of habitation have been found here since prehistoric times, and the Greek writer Homer mentions some of the towns in his works. Throughout the occupation of the Byzantines, Ottomans and Venetians, the inhabitants of Mani were given a fairly autonomous status – in exchange for an annual contribution – and resisted foreign occupiers and as such it is not surprising that one of the leaders of Greek independence came from this region. Besides its wild nature, the peninsula also has its typical architecture, the so-called tower-like houses that resemble defensive fortresses. Famous examples are the villages of Vathia and Gerolimenas but also the numerous remains of the dilapidated villages abandoned by the inhabitants during the 19th and 20th centuries. However, should you still be looking for some refreshment, the beautiful beaches of the Mediterranean are not far away.","tokens":1565,"chunks":[{"article_title":"Travels in Greece II: the Southeast of the Peloponnese","article_url":"https://www.hellenistichistory.com/2022/10/17/travels-in-greece-ii-the-southeast-of-the-peloponnese/","article_date":"2022-10-25T12:55:12+01:00","content":"In the first part of this series, we have already been introduced to the northern part of the Peloponnese, the peninsula in the south of mainland Greece.

He was the last of dozens of rajahs in ancient India descended from the soldiers of Alexander the Great. In Today’s guest Post Jaume Galiana, who runs the Helenismania profile on Instagram, tells us more about the Yavanarajas. These Yavanarajas, which we could translate as Greek kings, ruled much of present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India for almost 200 years. One of them, Amyntas, minted the largest silver coins of Antiquity. And yet, we have no more information about most of these kings than what numismatics can give us and the hypotheses that we can extract from them. This is the real reason why the Indo-Greeks are generally unknown to the general public and sometimes only briefly mentioned in general works about the Hellenistic age. The rulers of the “yavanarajya”, the Greek kingdom, were descendants of Greek settlers and soldiers who had lived in Central Asia since Alexander’s conquest. They later reconquered the Indian territories which had once subdued the Macedonian conqueror following the campaigns of the Greek kings of Bactria (present-day Afghanistan). Coin of the Graeco-Bactrian conqueror Antimachos I with an elephant and a Nike. Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http://www.cngcoins.com When the new territories of India conquered by the Greco-Bactrians separated from their kingdom, what we know as the Indo-Greek kingdoms then appeared. However, all of these territories were united only for a very short time. While some kings ruled from Alexandria in the Caucasus and Alexandria in Arachosia – in what is now southern Afghanistan -, others ruled from the great cities of northwestern India, such as Taxila, which was reached by Alexander, or Sagala, in the Punjab. In fact, these Indo-Greek capitals are mentioned in the Ramayana along with the cities of the Yavanas, i.e the Greeks (Ram Add. 4.41.867). Hundreds of Greek coins and objects have been found in these cities, which show a true cultural change after the Indo-Greek conquest. One example is the extension of Taxila following the Greek hypodamic layout. Sometimes the capitals were renamed with a Greek name, as is the case with Sagala (possible Euthydemia), or Pushkalavati, possible Peukelaotis. In fact, there was a short-lived Indo-Greek king named Peukolaos, whose name is clearly connected with this city, of which he may have been its ruler for a time. Coin of Peukolaos. Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http://www.cngcoins.com The most famous of the Greek maharajas is undoubtedly the well-known Menander I, present in both Greco-Roman and Indian sources. Probably born in Alexandria of the Caucasus (Begram, Afghanistan), he was descendant from Greek settlers in the Kabul Valley. It was Apollodorus of Artemita (Strab. XI, 11, 1) who attributed greater conquests to him than Alexander and speculated about his advance towards the Ganges, a fact that the Yuga Purana (47-48, 56-58) confirmed when speaking of a Greek expedition that would plunder the ancient capital of the Maurya empire, Pataliputra, the current Patna (India). According to a Buddhist source, the Milindapanha (“the questions of Menander”), the Indo-Greek Maharaja Menander I converted to Buddhism and abdicated the throne to retire to a life of meditation. In fact, it may be true that Menander favored Buddhism, as some of his coins show the dharma chakra. Plutarch (Moralia, 821 D-E) gives us a more reliable version in which the king would die on campaign. Interestingly, his ashes were distributed among stupas in different cities in a similar way to Buddha. At the death of the king, we observe a phenomenon similar to that of the death of Alexander the Great, since his kingdom seems to have fragmented into several dynasties that fought each other. Of one of these sovereigns, Traso Megas “the Great”, only one unpublished coin is known. Judging by the resemblance of his portrait to that of Menander, it is likely that he was his short- lived successor, soon deposed. One more proof of how much we still have to know about these sovereigns. But if there is a more remarkable case in Indo-Greek numismatics, it is that of Strato I. Generally accepted as the son of Menander, we observe how at the beginning he appears on the portrait of his coins accompanied by his mother Agathokleia as regent and with the appearance of a child. Agathokleia curiously has an Indianized appearance, as she appears with jewels set in her hair and a long Indian-style braid (Bopearachchi: 2015, p. 215). She will eventually disappear from the coins of her son Strato I, who will be portrayed only once he reaches adulthood. Drachm of Agathokleia with Strato I. Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http://www.cngcoins.com It is very likely that Strato I was up against a king named Heliokles II, perhaps from an exiled royal family from Bactria, as we can see from many overstrikes they may have fought for the control of what is now northern Pakistan. Despite the initial successes of Heliocles II, it is possible that Strato I recovered much that had already been lost at an old age. At the death of Strato I his kingdom seems to have been divided into kings of little importance. One of them, Epander, who could have reigned a small area near what is now New Delhi, minted coins with Athena offering victory and a zebu, the sacred animal par excellence in India, which even appears carved on one of Ashoka’s famous pillars. A good example of syncretism between the two cultures. Indian-standard coin of Epander. Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http://www.cngcoins.com Other Greek dynasties arose in the western part of present-day Pakistan and southern Afghanistan. The case of Lysias and Antialcidas is especially relevant, two kings who, as they minted coins in the same workshops, either ruled jointly or the latter was the immediate successor of the other. Lysias stands out because on his exceptional coins he appears crowned with a helmet in the shape of an elephant’s head, which Alexander the Great, Ptolemy I or Demetrius I of Bactria had already portrayed before alluding to India. Lysias called himself the Invincible and appears to have been a successful warrior-king. Coin of Lysias. Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http://www.cngcoins.com Both kings were also portrayed wearing the kausia, a typical Macedonian hat that is considered the predecessor of the popular pakol, very common in these countries nowadays. Antialcidas is the only Indo-Greek king for whom we have an inscribed source, a pillar with an inscription erected in Vidisha, more than a thousand kilometers away from Taxila, where he sent an embassy to the local rajah. The most curious thing is that the ambassador was a Hinduist Greek named Dion from Taxila. On his coins, Antialcidas depicts Zeus offering the Victory to a greeting elephant. Unfortunately, of the dozens of remaining kings we can only relatively place them in a region and a chronology which subject to constant revision, since there are no references to them in any source, neither written nor material. Despite this, we can observe that, especially in today’s Pakistan, for a century there was a veritable world of Rajahs of Greek origin who fought each other. As the historian A. K. Narain (1957: p. 102) stated in his day: “the Yavana seem to have been their worst enemies”. Traditionally it has been considered that the Indo-Greek kings were progressively conquered by an invasion of Scythian tribes that gradually gained ground over them. Although this is quite probable, the historian F. Widemann (2009: pp. 249-277) convincingly favors a passive emigration in which the Indo-Scythians gradually became Hellenized and finally one of them, Maues, succeeded the Indo-Greek king Archebius in Taxila. As if that were not enough, it is not true either that the Indo-Scythians were staunch enemies of the Indo-Greeks. Sometimes they allied themselves with Indo-Greek kings to fight other kings, whether Greek or Scythian, in a situation similar to the Muslim taifas of medieval Spain. In this context, it is logical to think that there were mixed marriages. It is possible that the Indo-Greek king Artemidorus was the son of Maues, either natural or adopted. He adopted Artemis as a goddess, unusual in the other dynasties, but as an archer goddess she seems to be related to Scythian customs. In fact, on coins like those of Hermaeus we can see that late Indo-Greek kings began to be depicted as horse archers. Coin of Hermaeus with his queen Kalliope. Note the bow behind the king on the reverse. Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http://www.cngcoins.com The most relevant case is that of Hippostratos, whose father Apollodotus II was the last great Indo-Greek king who reconquered Taxila from the Scythians around 70 BC. From his portrait, Hippostratus appears to be not entirely Greek, maybe he had either an Indian or a Scythian mother. On his coins he adopts Indian religious symbols and appears on horseback making the mudra, a Buddhist blessing. However, Hippostratus appears to have been a young king unable to hold his father’s territories. After him, the Indo-Greek kings retreated to eastern Punjab with their capital at Sagala, which was Menander’s capital, until the aforementioned Strato III was conquered ca. 10 AD. Coin of Hippostratus. Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http://www.cngcoins.com Interestingly, the Indo-Greek king Zoilus II, slightly earlier than Strato III, had chosen to depict symbols of Shiva (and perhaps the god himself) rather than another Greek deity to depict on his coins, as S. Bandhare showed (Mairs: 2021, pp. 520-537). A neighboring Indian rajah named Bhadrayasa imitated his coinage and we might even speculate that this sovereign was partly Greek. The representation of divinities and Indian religious motifs had already began previously with King Agathocles, who on his coins gave us the first representations of gods such as Balarama or Vashudeva. Or in the later case of Telephos, on whose coins a Brahmin appears on the reverse. The information we have about the Indo-Greeks has increased remarkably over the last decades. Previously, many of these kings were unknown and it was thought that their reigns ended much earlier, so we have to be enthusiastic and keep in mind that we still have a lot to discover. In fact, the historian F. Widemann has proposed (2009: pp. 385-401), through a reinterpretation of what were considered posthumous coins, that an Indo-Greek dynasty ruled Alexandria in the Caucasus until the end of the 1st century AD. I am sure the Yavanaraja still have a lot to surprise us, wouldn’t you agree? Jaume Galiana is a historian and a secondary school history teacher.

Sometimes they allied themselves with Indo-Greek kings to fight other kings, whether Greek or Scythian, in a situation similar to the Muslim taifas of medieval Spain. In this context, it is logical to think that there were mixed marriages. It is possible that the Indo-Greek king Artemidorus was the son of Maues, either natural or adopted.

For centuries, the Macedonian king has fascinated rulers, leaders and-the everyday man. The rapidity of his conquests and his young age made him legendary. Many were inspired by him, and even today his personality continues to enchant. Ancient sources tell us that Alexander was an extraordinary personality: he was endowed with charisma, ardour on the battlefield, wisdom and moderation in politics. This is the Alexander that has been handed down to us. Yet the same ancient sources that glorify Alexander, also report controversial episodes. In Alexander’s life there are several dark episodes, and listing them all would take a very long time. To better understand the problem at hand, it may be useful to mention a few, more illustrative examples. In fact, sometimes Alexander was led to behave harshly by events, such as the thwarted conspiracies that attempted to kill him, other times he seems to deliberately implement impulsive and violent behaviour. In this blog post Ivan Ceci explores some of the most famous Examples. Curtius Rufus reports that after the conquest of Phoenicia (332 BC) Alexander the Great moved his army to Egypt. On his way, he had to besiege Gaza, a city between Syria and Egypt. The Persian garrison was led by the eunuch Betis. After hard clashes, in which Alexander participated on the front line, the city was conquered. Betis survived the battle and was brought to the king. Betis’ contemptuous attitude provoked blind anger in Alexander, even though the eunuch was now a prisoner and the battle was won. The Macedonian king decided on a cruel punishment: he ordered to drag him alive tied to a chariot around the city. Alexander even boasted of having imitated Achilles, who dragged Hector’s lifeless body after winning the clash with him. Hector, however, was already dead, while Betis’ terrible death was caused by the wrath of Alexander (Curt. 4, 6, 7-29). After the Battle of Gaugamela, the Macedonian army moved into the interior of Persia and took the Persian capitals, such as Babylon, Pasargade, Susa and Persepolis. Alexander stayed in Persepolis in the winter between 331 and 330 BC. The city was very rich, full of monuments and had a treasure of 120 thousands of talents. During his stay, he attended many feasts, often getting drunk. Thais, a hetaera, apparently incited Alexander to destroy the city. Along with his drunken companions, he began to set fire to the royal palace and then to the whole city. A famous and rich city was thus destroyed because of the vices and recklessness of Alexander, which struck him when he abandoned himself to wine. Even the ancient sources, that describe the deeds of Alexander, mourn the sad end of such a glorious city (Curt. 5, 7, 2-10; Diod. 17, 70-72; Plut. Alex. 38; Arr. An. 3, 18, 11-12). The following episode is little more obscure, as there are only few sources that report it. In 329 Alexander was crossing the deserts of Sogdia, in Central Asia. Here he came upon a city, inhabited by the people of the Branchids. Their ancestors were a priestly family that held control of the oracle of Apollo at Didyma, near the city of Miletus. During the Second Persian War, they plundered the temple of Apollo to favor Xerxes. Because of this the other citizens of Miletus became angry with them and they were then forced to flee the city, moving to Sogdia with the approval of the Persian king. However, the Macedonian army also included Milesian soldiers. Alexander decided that they would decide the fate of the city, despite the warm welcome they had received by the people of the Branchids. However, the soldiers did not come to a decision, so it was left to Alexander to make the decision. He then surrounded the city with his army and ordered them to massacre all the inhabitants, to completely destroy the entire territory (Curt. 7, 5, 28-35). In 327 BC Alexander was in Maracanda, the scene of one of the most famous episodes of Alexander’s life. Cleitus was one of the most valiant Macedonian generals and saved Alexander’s life during the Battle of Granicus. The king decided to appoint Cleitus as satrap of Sogdiana. But the appointment as satrap of a distant region was seen as a punishment by the Macedonians, so Cleitus was quite resentful towards his king. During a feast, Alexander, Cleitus and the other participants were drunk. Alexander began to praise himself and belittle his father Philip, which sparked a reaction from Cleitus. A furious quarrel broke out between the two, they tried to hit each other but were stopped by their friends. Alexander was very angry and waited for Cleitus at the end of the feast. When he passed, he killed him with a sarissa. When the hangover passed, Alexander realized his grave action and even tried to kill himself (Curt. 8, 1-2; Arr. An. 4, 8-9; Plut. Alex. 50, 1-2). Almost all of the ancient sources report these episodes. However, some approach these critically – just like we should – and want to underline how Alexander had a dark side. In particular, the Latin authors are the ones who judge the Macedonian king the most, because they wanted to define the Roman Empire as militarily and morally more powerful compared to Alexander and his accomplishments. While the Greek sources report the episodes, they usually do not pay too much attention to them and tend even mock them, so as not to put the glorious Alexander in a bad light. Beyond the motivations of the ancient sources, these obscure episodes are important because they show us a different side of Alexander. He was not only a great king and general, but also a human being, subject to vices and bad passions.

In particular, the Latin authors are the ones who judge the Macedonian king the most, because they wanted to define the Roman Empire as militarily and morally more powerful compared to Alexander and his accomplishments. While the Greek sources report the episodes, they usually do not pay too much attention to them and tend even mock them, so as not to put the glorious Alexander in a bad light. Beyond the motivations of the ancient sources, these obscure episodes are important because they show us a different side of Alexander. He was not only a great king and general, but also a human being, subject to vices and bad passions.

But the main goal of the Hellenistic History platform is to provide you with more insight into the different aspects of the Hellenistic world. Aside from this series, in which we have a look at some of the famous and especially not-so-famous figures, you can also check out the Hellenistic Women and Hellenistic Cities series. In today’s blog post I want to introduce you to Lydiades of Megalopolis. Why we do not know his exact date of birth, Lydiades of Megalopolis, who was part of the city’s elite, rose to prominence in late 250s BC . Both he and other members of his family are well attested in the epigraphical material of Megalopolis: Lydiades and his father Eudamos were the subject of a hero cult (SEG 52 447) and his son Aristopamon had an equestrian statue dedicated to him (SEG 48 524). Pausanias mentions him as one of the Megalopolitan leaders at the Battle of Mantinea in 249 BC. This seems to have increased his influence in the city and allowed him to establish himself as the sole ruler of the polis. Like other tyrants in the Peloponnese, Lydiades had most likely come to power with the support of the Macedonian kings who benefited from the installment of pro-Macedonian governments. After about ten years of sole-rule, in 235 BC, Lydiades gave up his power over Megalopolis and the city became part of the Achaean League. Lydiades himself became a successful Achaean statesman, becoming a formidable rival of Aratus of Sikyon in the process. He was chosen as the strategos or federation’s leader three times between 234 and 229 BC. Aratus, who up until that point had been the star of the Achaean Koinon, is said to have been less than thrilled with this sudden competition and their relationship soured in this period. When Lydiades tried to convince the Achaians of the necesity for an expedition against Sparta, he was opposed by Aratos (Plut. Ar. 30. 3). Yet, Megalopolis came under Spartan attack in 226 BC during the Achaian War with Kleomenes, Lydiades went on to defend it in the battle at Mount Lykaion, even when Aratos, who was acting as strategos, had not consented to a confrontation with the enemy (Plut. Kleo. 6). Lydiades, who had been chosen as the the League’s hipparch, led the cavalry against the Spartans, but his over-eagerness led him to make mistakes and fell on the battlefield. Now that you know a bit more about Lydiades and his life, on question remains. Why would a tyrant give up his power and choose for his city to become part of a federal state? According to Polybius, (Pol. 2. 44. 5): ‘Λυδιάδας μὲν οὖν ὁ Μεγαλοπολίτης ἔτι ζῶντος Δημητρίου, κατὰ τὴν αὑτοῦ προαίρεσιν, πάνυ πραγματικῶς καὶ φρονίμως προϊδόμενος τὸ μέλλον ἀπετέθειτο τὴν τυραννίδα καὶ μετεσχήκει τῆς ἐθνικῆς συμπολιτείας’ ‘while Demetrios was still alive, Lydiades of Megalopolis anticipated the future, laid down his tyranny willingly with great pragmatism and good sense, and adhered to the ethnic confederation’. Both Plutarch and Pausanias continue this positive depiction of Lydiades. It is more than likely however that both Plutarch and Pausanias had based their accounts on that of Polybius, who – as a Megalopolitan himself – had every reason to paint an extremely favourable picture of the man that joined Megalopolis with the Achaian koinon. This makes it even more difficult to get an answer, but this does not leave us without options. However, it must have become apparent by 235 BC that Achaia under the leadership of Aratos, at least in the Peloponnese, was a force to be reckoned with. Both Lydiades and his predecessor Aristodamos were men who like other tyrants in the Peloponnese had come to power as tyrants in their city through the support of Macedon. Lydiades may therefore have realised that renouncing his claim on the city would be the best possible course of action. Additionally Plutarch also tells us that (Plut. Ar. 30. 1): ‘ὡς δ᾽ οὖν τὸν Ἀρίστιππον ἀνεῖλεν, εὐθὺς ἐπεβούλευσε Λυδιάδῃ τῷ Μεγαλοπολίτῃ τυραννοῦντι τῆς ἑαυτοῦ πατρίδος’ (‘after he (Aratos) had defeated Aristippos (i.e. the tyrant of Argos), he started to plot immediately against Lydiades, who was a tyrant in his hometown of Megalopolis.). This statement suggests that the idea of an Achaian attack on Megalopolis was a genuine possibility and will have played a significant role in the motivations of Lydiades as well as the polis to join the federation.228 As his actions in Sikyon in 251 BC (Plut. Ar. 4-9) and Argos in 229 BC illustrate (Plut. Ar. 4-9; 27-29), Aratos did not hesitate to abolish tyrannies in the Peloponnese that were established through Macedonian support. Nonetheless, the apparent selflessness of the ex-tyrant’s actions should be doubted. Judging from the rest of Plutarch’s account it appears Lydiades was also motivated by a sense of self preservation. After all, he did have a promising career within federal politics after Megalopolis became part of the Achaian koinon (Plut. Ar. 30-31). While the koinon was a democracy, former tyrants could easily pursue a political career for themselves, since Lydiades is not the only one to become an Achaian strategos. For example, a year after Argos joined the Achaian koinon, its former tyrant Aristomachos was chosen as strategos. In conclusion, Lydiades was motivated by personal gain, as is illustrated by his subsequent federal career, but his motives behind the decision to give up his tyranny of Megalopolis were also connected to the well-being of the polis and its citizens who could have exercised pressure from below for a non-tyrannical, democratic government.","tokens":1699,"chunks":[{"article_title":"Hellenistic People III: Lydiades of Megalopolis","article_url":"https://www.hellenistichistory.com/2022/08/11/hellenistic-people-iii-lydiades-of-megalopolis/","article_date":"2022-08-11T11:08:35+01:00","content":"On this website you can find all sorts of articles about the Ancient Greek world.

It reflected on the natural, physical landscape in ways Greek poetry had not before. The rise of pastoral poetry – poems about the idealized shepherd reflecting on nature – can be attributed to this period. But the Hellenistic age also brought us female poets who made significant and lasting contributions. In this guest-blog Jon-David Hague tells us more about the poetry of Anyte, one of those women poets. She came from the Arcadian city of Tegea on the Greek Peloponnese, which today is less than an hour’s drive north from Sparta. We know almost nothing about Anyte but estimate she lived and wrote around 300 BCE, at the start of the Hellenistic period. In fact, we have only a few of her poems, but that is still more than any other ancient Greek female poet aside from the well-known Sappho, who lived on the Greek island of Lesbos in the late 7th century BCE. While it is interesting as to why we still have poems of hers today, first I want to introduce you to what her poetry felt like. Anyte wrote epigrams, which are short poems written in couplets that have a hexameter line followed by a pentameter line, like this (“–” is a musical measure twice as long as “u”): – uu –uu –uu –uu –uu – – – uu –uu – || –uu – uu – Try it. You can hear yourself singing “da ditty da ditty da ditty da ditty da ditty da da da ditty da ditty da (pause) da ditty da ditty da” Let’s look at one of her poems and work towards getting a sense of it. Below, a stylized American English pronunciation first follows the ancient Greek with the bolded parts helping with the metrical longs (the “da’s”). Then my attempt at an actual poetic translation (which is always a re-seeing). ἕσταθι τᾷδε, κράνεια βροτοκτόνε, μηδ᾽ ἔτι λυγρόν χάλκεον ἀμφ᾽ ὄνυχα στάζε φόνον δαΐων, ἀλλ᾽ ἀνὰ μαρμάρεον δόμον ἡμένα αἰπὺν Ἀθάνας ἄγγελλ᾽ ἀνορέαν Κρητὸς Ἐχεκρατίδα. Hestathi tie-deh, craney-a brotok-toneh, meyd’ eti lugron chalkeon amph’ onukha || stadze phonon da-ee-own all’ ana marmareon domon hemena aipun Athanas ang-ell’ anore-an || Kreytos Ek-hek-kratida. Stay here where you are, Spear, wooden manslayer, And stop dripping enemy death, painful round your bronzed tip. But lie there now high in the bright house of Athena and tell everyone of the man-ness of Cretan Echekratidas. As you read and re-read the poem, you might want to consider that epigrams were originally written on stone: they were in essence dedications meant to last forever. Likely, Anyte had this idea also in mind. Imagine walking by Athena’s temple in Tegea. You stop. While you stand there, think about this poem. The first two words are a command to “Stand/Stop here!” At first, you might think Anyte is telling you, the passerby, to stop where you are, stand there, and read this in front of the temple. But as you keep reading, you see that you, the reader, who now embodies the voice of the poem, are telling this soldier’s spear to stand here/stop here. Maybe you can see the spear inside the temple. You look at it. You see that bronze tip of the spear that must have killed many men. You imagine blood dripping down from the tip. But that was the past. Now the spear is retired and has been put in Athena’s temple to remind people of its owner. How do we see this poem differently as a woman having composed it? Was Anyte asked to write the poem for the day the spear was dedicated? Did she see the spear in the temple and think to write a dedicatory poem about it? How did she feel about war and does this poem give us any insights? There is much we can imagine from these few words in these couplets that give a glimpse into the Hellenistic period, and which we will explore in another post.

The rise of pastoral poetry – poems about the idealized shepherd reflecting on nature – can be attributed to this period. But the Hellenistic age also brought us female poets who made significant and lasting contributions. In this guest-blog Jon-David Hague tells us more about the poetry of Anyte, one of those women poets. She came from the Arcadian city of Tegea on the Greek Peloponnese, which today is less than an hour’s drive north from Sparta. We know almost nothing about Anyte but estimate she lived and wrote around 300 BCE, at the start of the Hellenistic period.

While it is interesting as to why we still have poems of hers today, first I want to introduce you to what her poetry felt like. Anyte wrote epigrams, which are short poems written in couplets that have a hexameter line followed by a pentameter line, like this (“–” is a musical measure twice as long as “u”): – uu –uu –uu –uu –uu – – – uu –uu – || –uu – uu – Try it.

But as you keep reading, you see that you, the reader, who now embodies the voice of the poem, are telling this soldier’s spear to stand here/stop here. Maybe you can see the spear inside the temple. You look at it. You see that bronze tip of the spear that must have killed many men. You imagine blood dripping down from the tip. But that was the past.

I love the history of the country as well as the food, people and language. Having lived there for a few years, I have been able to travel extensively through several regions and visit the archaeological sites and musea. In this new series, I want to take you on a little tour of Greece by looking at some of the nicest and most historical regions of the country. And what better place to start then the north of the Peloponnese. The Peloponnese is a peninsula in the south of mainland Greece. The region is characterised by its immensely beautiful coastlines and mountainous landscapes, filled with archaeological ruins and olive groves. The Peloponnese has always played an important role in the history of Greece. This was the place where the earliest figures in Greek mythology fought against legendary monsters such as the Nemeid lion. Or where the Mycenaean kings departed from their fortresses to the ancient Troy. Even today, numerous traces of that past can be found on this peninsula. High time, therefore, to take a look at what this region has to offer the historical traveller. Corinth The Corinthian Canal The start of every journey in the Peloponnese begins with a visit to the Isthmus of Corinth. Since ancient times, this isthmus has been the only point where the peninsula is connected to the central part. Today, visitors can make a small stop at the Corinthian Canal. Although it was hoped to create a short cut since ancient times, the canal was built only shortly after Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830 and was completed nine years later. From the top of the footbridge, you get a great view of the canal. Of course, you can also choose to cross the canal by boat. Ancient Corinth Not far from the Isthmus of Corinth, are the ruins of the city of Corinth itself. This city was founded in the 10th century B.C. and played a major role in the early history of the Greek city-states. In 146 B.C. the city was destroyed by the Romans, but in 44 B.C. Julius Caesar rebuilt the city and after the visit of the Apostle Paul to the city in 49 or 50 A.D., it became one of the most important early Christian centres. Today you can still see various remains of the city such as the temple of Apollo built in 7th century BC. Slightly above this archaeological site is the Akrokorinthos, a high rocky hill that served as the city’s acropolis in antiquity and the Middle Ages, to which it was connected by long walls. Behind the highest of the three gates you can see the remains of a city that was built and destroyed by the Turks. Argos The castle palace of Mycenae Slightly below the region of Corinth, lies the Argolis. In this region you will find several interesting sights, but none is as special as the castle palace of Mycenae. Between 1600 and 1100 BC, the Mycenaeans controlled the entire region from here and it was the political and cultural centre of the Mycenaean civilisation. By the way, it was in this period that Homer’s famous heroes Agamemnon and Achilles set out for Troy to retrieve the Spartan queen Helena. The cyclopean walls and famous lion gate were excavated in 1870 by German ‘archaeologist’ Heinrich Schliemann (who had also previously discovered the remains of Troy). The city itself was composed of a fortified citadel and neighbouring settlement, which had its peak between 1450 and 1200 BC. Apart from the remains of the palace, two circles of royal tombs were found with an enormously rich gold treasure. Schliemann also discovered an impressive golden death mask that he naturally attributed to Agamemnon, but which we now know is much older than first estimated. There is an impressive museum at the site itself, but many of the finds are now on display at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. Epidauros – the healing power of Asklepios Another place of interest in the Argolis, is to be found a little more to the west: ancient Epidauros. This city was known in ancient times for its sanctuary of the demigod Asklepios. In this sanctuary, people came from far and wide to be cured of all kinds of ailments. From the 6th century BC, pilgrims could spend a night here in the enkoimeteria (the big sleeping hall) hoping that the god would cure them in their dreams during the night. It remained a popular pilgrimage site until it was destroyed by the Goths in 395. Today, ancient Epidauros is still a major tourist attraction because of its large theatre. Built in the 4th century BC, it is in such good condition that it has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. Although it was not the largest theatre in the Peloponnese – that honour was reserved for the theatre of Megalopolis – it could hold around 14,000 spectators for all kinds of performances. The theatre is also known for its excellent acoustics, which may be one of the reasons why many performances and concerts still take place there today. Apart from the theatre, in Epidauros you can see many other remains of the sanctuary: for example the temple of Asklepios (4th century BC), the stadium where a sports event was organised in honour of the demigod (5th century BC) and the enkoimeterion. Nauplion A little more to the west of Mycenae, you will find Nauplion. This city was the first capital of Greece after independence and is characterised by its Venetian architecture. The city has been an important port since prehistoric times, but had a great period of prosperity in the Middle Ages. During this period, the city was controlled by different peoples – Byzantines, Franks, Turks and Venetians, but it was mainly the latter who had a lasting impact on the city’s architecture. The heart of the city, the Platia Syntagmatos, was built by the Venetians and they also built the Palamidi citadel between 1711 and 1714. This citadel is made up of eight autonomous bastions that fell to the Turks in 1715 after only one week of siege. You have to walk a bit, but the complex offers a great overview of the city and Argolic Gulf. In the middle of this Bay of Nauplion, you can see the so-called Bourzi Island, named after the Turkish word for tower. On this island, the Venetians built a fortress in the 15th century to ward off approaching enemies. After Greek independence, the defensive tower served as a prison and even a hotel. The city has a third fortress: the Akranafplio fortress. This is one of the oldest parts of the city: in ancient times, the acropolis of the ancient city was located here, but the Byzantines later converted it into a fortress. The combination of Venetian architecture, beautiful views and relaxed atmosphere has rightly made this city one of the most romantic places in the northern Peloponnese. It is certainly worthwhile to take a stroll along the embankment in the sunset and relax after a busy first acquaintance with the Peloponnese.","tokens":1531,"chunks":[{"article_title":"Travels in Greece I : the nothern Peloponnese","article_url":"https://www.hellenistichistory.com/2022/06/03/travels-in-greece-i-the-nothern-peloponnese/","article_date":"2022-06-03T12:52:45+01:00","content":"I think that it must not come as a surprise, but I love Greece.

About high time we change this and delve into the short history of yet another Greek city during the Hellenistic period. This time we turn our eye to Messene. This city lies in the southern part of the Peloponnese in close proximity to Ancient Sparta. Today, as a result of extensive archaeological excavations, the archaeological site of Ancient Messene is one of the most impressive in the whole of Greece. Which is definitely worth a visit if you get a chance! When it was founded in 369 BC, Messene already had an established place in the Greek world. It is important to note however that at the time of the foundation, there was a difference between the region of Messene and the polis Messene, originally called Ithome after the mountain that was in close proximity to the city. By the second century AD, however, the city had taken the name Messene and the wider region around it was now called Messenia, indicating that the polis had established itself as the center of the region. Just as with the foundation of Megalopolis, the reason for the creation of Messene (or Ithome) lies in the changing political reality of the Peloponnese after the Spartan defeat at Leuktra. Up until that point, the people living in the region had primarily been united as Helots and perioikoi under Spartan control but after the Theban defeat of Sparta, they believed the time was right to curb Spartan power even further by uniting in a political state (Paus. 4. 26. 6; 4. 28. 1). Who better to (re)found such a city, than the Theban general Epaminondas. He is credited with this achievement by several ancient authors: Plutarch (Ages. 34. 1), Diodorus (15. 66. 1), Nepos (Ep. 8. 4) and Pausanias who states that both the Messenians and the Thebans considered him to be the founder of the polis (Paus. 4. 31. 10; 9. 15. 6). The remains of the stadium at Messene. In the centuries after its foundation, the city was regularly confronted by invasions. Due to its geographical proximity to Sparta and the earlier history between the two cities, there was a natural enmity between them and frequent Spartan attacks followed after 369 BC such as he attack by the Spartan king Nabis in 201 BC (Plut. Phil. 12. 4-5). The emergence of Philip of Macedon, however, was greeted by the Messenians with open arms, establishing a history of close cooperation between the Macedonian kings and the two city. Messene was a Macedonian ally in several of the big conflicts such as the battle of Chaironea in 338 BC and the Chremonidean War (267-261 BC), for which it was highly rewarded as it gained control of areas previously belonging to Sparta. However, after Alexander’s campaigns and under the rule of the Antigonid dynasty, this close relationship seems to have deteriorated a little with Messene choosing to remain neutral in most conflicts. In 191 BC the polis was inducted into the Achaean Koinon in 191 BC under its strategos Diophanes of Megalopolis (Livy 36. 31. 1-10). This happened much against the will of the citizens and it was the start of a troubled between two states who always been at odds as they ended up on opposite sides of many conflicts, since Messene was always weary of the expansionist policy of the koinon which threatened city’s independence. Consequently, the Messenians were not thrilled about their Achaian membership (Pol. 22. 10. 4-6) and under an influential Messenian named Deinokrates the polis tried to secede in 183 BC. Philopoimen, who was the strategos of the koinon, tried to curb the rebellion but was captured and killed in Messene (Plut. Phil. 18; Livy 39. 49; Paus. 4. 29. 12). Following Philopoimen’s death, Lykortas took over as strategos and ransacked Messene and the surrounding areas. At the end of the rebellion, Philopoimen’s body was transported back to Megalopolis and buried there, accompanied by great honours. Eventually a statue of the statesman was erected in his hometown Megalopolis and he received a lavish funerary procession and his own cult (IG V 2 432). The relationship between the Koinon and the city remained strained and when the Koinon was defeated by the Romans in 146 BC, the polis was one of the first cities to surrender and remained an important Greek city under the Roman rule.

Today, as a result of extensive archaeological excavations, the archaeological site of Ancient Messene is one of the most impressive in the whole of Greece. Which is definitely worth a visit if you get a chance! When it was founded in 369 BC, Messene already had an established place in the Greek world.

Since most of the sources come from the epigraphic material of the Hellenistic period, we have already looked several times at how mythological kinship was used by cities in that period in their interactions with third parties. We have further also seen how Alexander the Great used his descent from great mythological heroes such as Heracles and in his contacts with conquered territories. After Alexander the Great’s death, his successors continued this use in their contacts with the Greek poleis. But what form did these contacts take in the changing world of the late Hellenistic period? After the sudden death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C., his followers were left with a problem. He had died far too early and the heir to his great empire, Alexander IV, was only a small child and thus incapable of ruling. For his generals and friends, moreover, choosing a successor proved more difficult than expected, and they were soon embroiled in a war of succession. In the so-called Diadochen Wars (322-281 B.C.) they fought against each other to conquer their own part of Alexander the Great’s empire. In the end, three major kingdoms remained: the Ptolemaic Empire in Egypt, the Seleukids in the eastern part of Alexander’s empire, and the Antigonids in Macedonia. The arrival of these kingdoms brought about quite a change for the Greek cities. Unlike before, these cities now also had to reckon with a new power dynamic in which these kings held an important position. In many cases the cities were also located in an area that was part of one of these kingdoms and they were then under the direct or indirect control of these kings. It is therefore not surprising that mythological links between the cities and these kings are also frequently referred to in the interactions between the various parties. Time to look at some examples. Between 208 and 203 BC, there are several instances of Ionian cities applying for immunity from Hellenistic kings. This is not surprising because during these years Rome and her allies waged war against Philippus V of Macendonia and her Greek allies. After this war was stopped for a short period in 205 and Philippus V was able to turn his attention to Ionia. The Seleukidi sche king Antiochus III was also on his way back to the region from his eastern satrapies. Thus, it was the ideal opportunity for the Ionian cities to launch a kinship claim because it could save a city from possible plunder or destruction. One such claim is the campaign by the inhabitants of Magnesia to recognize their festival of Artemis Leucophrene, as already discussed in earlier parts of this series. Among the many responses preserved in this campaign is that of Antioch in Persis, where Antiochus III was residing at the time. The citizens of this city praised the Magnesians for recognizing the kinship between their two cities. This kinship was a bit more recent than we have seen so far because several generations before, the inhabitants of the city were asked by Antiochus I to be able to populate as settlers the new settlements of the Seleukic kings. In this case, the Magnesia essentially also became the mother city of Antioch in Persis. This makes it a little easier for us to trace this kinship claim; after all, we don’t have to go back to some mythical ancestor. The inhabitants of Antioch also hope that the inhabitants of Magnesia will continue their current political orientation, i.e. continue their support for Antiochus III. It thus also seems plausible that Antiochus III played an active role in the response of the city of Antioch to the request of the Magnesians. This is also evident in another example. In 204/203 BC Antiochus III conquered the coastal city of Teos and declared their city and land sacred and immune from confiscation. As a result, residents of the city began a similar recognition campaign as the Magnesians. Among other things, they also sent envoys to cities in Crete that they had a so-called kinship link with, probably based on a Minoan link. The interesting thing here is that Antiochus III also sent his own representatives along with the envoys to the Cretan cities. This was to ensure that the cities under his sphere of influence remained protected after all. The relations between the cities and the Hellenistic king thus also played an important factor in the interactions between the cities themselves in the late Hellenistic period. In the case of cities that were under their direct (or indirect) control, the presence and desires of these monarchs seems to have had an impact on the way the cities interacted anyway. And as the examples discussed show, these princes were also familiar with political and diplomatic customs, including the use of mythological and non-mythological kinship. Clearly, they also had no hesitation in using these processes for their own benefit by encouraging certain cities to use their kinship with other cities. If they could then subtly – or also somewhat less subtly – point out there their positive relationship with kings such as Antiochus III or Philippus V, that was then only a good thing.

So far we have already seen why the Greeks eagerly used the legendary heroes and kings of Greek mythology for diplomatic purposes. We know how they did it, for what audience, and what role these stories played in the early history of a city. Some mythological figures were more popular than others in this process, often because it was easier to make a connection based on a “lineage” of someone like Achilles. Of course, one could also approach this from a different angle by giving new ancestry to a local hero and fitting this new genealogy into the broader mythological framework. All these elements resulted in an enormously complex network of mythological relationships in which it sometimes becomes very confusing for us – and for the Greeks – to know which hero has a connection with a particular city or people. Phokis, both today and in ancient times, is a region in central Greece of which Delphi was an important part. Mount Parnassus lies in the middle of the region which, among other things, ensured that this area retained a very rural character. No large cities developed there because the most important places such as Delphi were of great cultural or strategic importance. Not much is known about the Phokis’ early history but their control of the sanctuary at Delphi caused some conflicts losinf control of the sanctuary several times in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. During the Persian Wars, the Phokians fought on both sides. Even during the Hellenistic period, control of Delphi remained a major point of contention until Philip of Macedon took it from them in 346 BC, and from the 3rd century Phokis was controlled by the Macedonian kings before finally becoming a member of the Aetolian Koinon in 196 BC. Of course, the Phokians also had a legendary founder after whom they were named: Phokis. Only there was a small problem here: there were two heroes with this name. Both of whom were connected to this region in one way or another. The geographer Pausanias explains the problem as follows: “It is clear that the name Phocis, at least the part around Tithorea and Delphi, was derived in antiquity from a man from Corinth, Phocus of Ornytion. A few years later the name won out over the whole country we now call Phocis, after the Aeginetians arrived by ship with Phocus, son of Aeacus.” (Pope. 10.1.1) So if you have been paying attention, it becomes clear that there are two men named Phocus: the first is the son of Aeacus and was seen as the one who gave his name to the whole region, the other a man from Corinth, the son of Ortynion and whose name was given to the region around Tithorea and Delphi. Thus, according to Pausanias, both men played a role in the history of the area at about the same time. This is an interesting fact, since one individual with this name would have been enough anyway. So why do our sources speak of two eponymous heroes? To answer this question, it may be necessary to take a look at the figures in question. Phocus number one – the son of Aeacus – is a well-known Panhellenic figure and appears frequently in Greek literature. His mother was a nymph named Psamanthe and the mythological king Aeacus of the island of Aegina. When the king chose Phocus over his half-brothers Peleus and Telamon, Phocus was murdered by them. The second Phocus – i.e., the son of Ornytion – is much less known and appears only in Pausanias, certain Homeric scholia and a periegesis for Nicomedes IV of Bithynia from the first century B.C. From these texts it is clear that Ornytion or Ornytus, the father of Phocus, was the son of Sisyphus. On an Attic skyphos or drinking cup we can probably also find an image of Phocus around 400 BC along with Antiope. There are several versions of the story of Antiope and in one of them Phocus cures Antiope of the madness that Dionysos had given her. Furthermore, Pausanias tells us the following: ‘There is in Daulis a place called Tronis, where a sanctuary for the founder was built. Some say this hero is Xanthippus, who distinguished himself in war, while others say Phocus son of Ornytion son of Sisyphus. Either way, he receives cultic honors every day.’ (Paus. 10.4.10). Although the exact location of this shrine is not known, some scholars believe it could be near the Phocicon. This was the central meeting place for the magistrates of the Phokian Koinon, which is described a few lines later by Pausanias. The Phokian Koinon was established around 510 BC as a response to external threats from other peoples such as the Boeotians, the Locrians, and the Thessalians. If this was the case, then this shrine to Phocus – and therefore Phocus son of Ornytion – was also important to the Phokians and the Phokian Koinon. So it is clear that both men played an important role in the history of the area. Phocus number one was pretty soon seen as the progenitor of the entire enthnos of the Phokians, a logical consequence of his Panhellenic fame. But what about the other Phocus? Looking again at our sources, it is possible that it too continued to play a role in the formation of the Phokian identity. If the sanctuary discussed by Pausanias really was that of Phocus and was located close to the Phocicion, then we can also state that the son of Ornytion could have played a role in the political ambitions of the Phocian Koinon.

Both of whom were connected to this region in one way or another. The geographer Pausanias explains the problem as follows: “It is clear that the name Phocis, at least the part around Tithorea and Delphi, was derived in antiquity from a man from Corinth, Phocus of Ornytion. A few years later the name won out over the whole country we now call Phocis, after the Aeginetians arrived by ship with Phocus, son of Aeacus.” (Pope.

Thus, according to Pausanias, both men played a role in the history of the area at about the same time. This is an interesting fact, since one individual with this name would have been enough anyway. So why do our sources speak of two eponymous heroes? To answer this question, it may be necessary to take a look at the figures in question. Phocus number one – the son of Aeacus – is a well-known Panhellenic figure and appears frequently in Greek literature.

When the king chose Phocus over his half-brothers Peleus and Telamon, Phocus was murdered by them. The second Phocus – i.e., the son of Ornytion – is much less known and appears only in Pausanias, certain Homeric scholia and a periegesis for Nicomedes IV of Bithynia from the first century B.C. From these texts it is clear that Ornytion or Ornytus, the father of Phocus, was the son of Sisyphus. On an Attic skyphos or drinking cup we can probably also find an image of Phocus around 400 BC along with Antiope. There are several versions of the story of Antiope and in one of them Phocus cures Antiope of the madness that Dionysos had given her.

Some say this hero is Xanthippus, who distinguished himself in war, while others say Phocus son of Ornytion son of Sisyphus. Either way, he receives cultic honors every day.’ (Paus. 10.4.10) Although the exact location of this shrine is not known, some scholars believe it could be near the Phocicon. This was the central meeting place for the magistrates of the Phokian Koinon, which is described a few lines later by Pausanias. The Phokian Koinon was established around 510 BC as a response to external threats from other peoples such as the Boeotians, the Locrians, and the Thessalians.

So it is clear that both men played an important role in the history of the area. Phocus number one was pretty soon seen as the progenitor of the entire enthnos of the Phokians, a logical consequence of his Panhellenic fame. But what about the other Phocus? Looking again at our sources, it is possible that it too continued to play a role in the formation of the Phokian identity. If the sanctuary discussed by Pausanias really was that of Phocus and was located close to the Phocicion, then we can also state that the son of Ornytion could have played a role in the political ambitions of the Phocian Koinon.

They are almost always figures who come from outside and found a new city in the region or were the ancestor or forefather of a new dynasty to rule over an existing polis. Most Greeks of the mainland considered themselves as descendants of foreigners. Thus, the inhabitants of Boeotia came to Greece some sixty years after the Trojan War and after the Mycenaean period most cities in the Peloponnese were ruled by descendants of the Herakles. These with their Doric companions took over many of the existing Greek cities during the Doric invasions. In fact, among foundation myths different kinds can be distinguished. The first are the myths surrounding the so-called primordial figures. These myths are often created to give the names of cities, rivers or whole regions and generally remain rather vague.

Each post tells us more about the general history, population or specific aspects of these Greek cities. In today’s post Shiro Burnette continues his exploration of Alexandria, this time we learn more about hybrid worship in Alexandria. Amulet, Head of an Apis Bull The Metropolitan Museum of Art Gift of Helen Miller Gould, 1910 Though Macedonian by birth, Alexander the Great made it a priority on his arrival to Egypt to visit the oracle of Amun. This action alone communicated an unspoken acknowledgement of the Egyptian religious cult and was a level of respect that the previous Persian satrap, or governor, did not pay to the indigenous Egyptians. During his visit to the oracle of Amun, a priest referred to Alexander as the “child of God”, presumably of Amun himself. Though some speculate whether this was potentially a linguistic misunderstanding, the readily accepted notion of Alexander as the child of an Egyptian deity served as a strong foundation of the interreligious traditions of Alexandria. When Ptolemy I assumed control of Alexandria and the lands surrounding it, he was well aware of Alexander’s pseudo-divine status. He was also in tune with the fact of the previous Persian disregard, in some respects, to certain sacred Egytipan festivals, particularly with regards to the cult of the Apis Bull. As such, Ptolemy knew that constructing a religious cult in Alexandria was a delicate matter and required sensitivity, and thus, sought the aid of the high priest of Heliopolis, Manetho. With Manetho’s aid, Ptolemy formulated the deity Osorapis, or Serapis, a combination of the Egyptian god of the dead, Osiris, and the Apis Bull. This notion of combining multiple deities into one was not unknown to Egyptians as gods were frequently combined for a specific purpose or function. For example, if the god Amun needed to perform a fertility role, he would temporarily obtain the “force” of Min, god of fertility, and become the hybrid deity Amun-Min. While a combination of Egyptian deities, the physical form of the Serapis was largely Greek in style. Head of Serapis It would not be enough, however, to have a deity that was merely recognizable. Serapis would have to be seen as a legitimate addition to both pantheons and therefore worthy of worship. In order to garner the support of Greek citizens, Ptolemy appealed to the incoming philosophers to Alexandria, particularly Demetrius of Phalerum. Demetrius was both a pupil of Aristotle and a prominent Athenian statesman. As such, he held a considerable amount of influence following a ten-year rule over the Athenian city-state. Upon arriving in Alexandria, Demetrius was said to have been temporarily rendered blind, only to regain his sight after praying to the newly formed god, Serapis. In garnering support from native Egyptians, Ptolemy benefited greatly from Manetho’s secondary role as a historian. Manetho’s chronology of pharaohs served as an official mode of legitimizing not only Ptolemy’s role as Alexandria’s and Egypt’s ruler but subsequently granting authority to the works created under him, including the cult of Serapis. Thus Ptolemy I, the Greek ruler of Egypt, fashioned a new deity that, like him, reflected both cultures. Serapis, Greek in form and Egyptian in lore, represented the hybrid culture that flourished in the southern Hellenic world. Head of Ptolemy I Ptolemy I’s work in carefully fusing Greek and Egyptian cultural practices culminated into his declaration of becoming a Pharaoh of Egypt. This surpassed the level of control that the Persians held as they merely employed satraps to govern the region. Ptolemy Soter, literally Ptolemy the Savior, thus took a more involved role in ruling over this empire, and he made sure to communicate that level of integration visually. On a personal level, Ptolemy and his immediate family began to adopt Egyptian customs and norms over time, such as traditional clothing. Nevertheless, he also was keen to retain notions of his own identity that communicated his Greek background such as speaking Greek as opposed to Egyptian. As such, Ptolemy himself presented himself as a culturally liminal figure, existing in between Greek and Egytptian cultural practices and typologies. The artistic culture that developed throughout the Ptolemaic Empire followed suit as it demonstrated a defined level of blending and hybridization. Head of Ptolemy II Just as both Greek and Egyptian audiences could read the cult statue of Serapis, so too could they understand the monumental and common art in Alexandria. Consider, for instance, the varying statues of Ptolemy Soter and his family. Once he was seen as the Pharaoh of the Ptolemaic Empire, the monumental statues of him followed the style of the great pharaohs before with their rigid expression and posture, often with one foot leading to the other, ceremonial neme headdress, and the use of diorite or greywacke, two materials readily available in Egypt. These figures differed greatly from the traditional representations of leaders in the Greek world which were often presented in marble busts and more natural characteristics. This Egyptianizing image of Ptolemy introduced him to the canon of Egyptian pharaohs, thus granting official authority as a ruler of Egypt.

In the last two contributions, I have paid extensive attention to the figure of Alexander the Great and we have looked at which mythological ancestors the Macedonian king had and how this descent can still be seen in material sources. In this last part on Alexander the Great, I think it is high time to look at how Alexander used this mythological lineage during his conquests. The use of mythological affiliations between two parties was already a regular part of the Greek diplomatic toolbox before the start of the Hellenistic period. This means that Alexander was very familiar with this phenomenon and could use it frequently during his military campaigns. Most examples of this date from the early years of his travels and come from Greeks or Asia Minor where Alexander seems to have followed a long tradition. The best-known example comes from Thessaly where, shortly after the death of Philippus in 336 BC, Alexander sought to nip local resistance in the bud. The Greek poleis had hoped that the transition from Philip to Alexander would provide an opportunity to throw off the influence of Macedonia once and for all. However, this proved to be beyond Alexander, who needed the Thessalian horsemen for his conquests. He defeated the Thessalians on the field and invoked the following arguments to convince them of his kingship: he had inherited the title of archon (the leader of the Thessalian League) from his father and reminded them of ‘his relationship with them through his mother, who was of the race of the Aeacids (Just. 11.3.1)’. In another version of the story he uses his father’s link with Heracles (Diod. 17.4.1). It is clear that he used the kinship connection with the Thessalians to restore the alliance with them. The sources also show that the Greeks accepted his claim: after all, his lineage had been known for generations. When Alexander arrived in Ilium – also known as Troy , he spared the local population from violence, according to Strabo, who took care of them ‘on the basis of a renewed kinship and because of his zeal for Homer. On the basis of this zeal and of his kinship through the Aeacids, who had been kings of the Molossi, of whom Andromache, Hector’s wife, as the story goes, was also queen, Alexander treated the Ilians kindly (Strabo 13.1.27).’ He is also said to have offered sacrifices to Priam on the altar of Zeus Hercius and a laurel wreath on the tomb of Achilles (Arr. 1.11.). It is clear from this, by the way, that Alexander did not see the Trojans as the ‘barbarians’ who appear in Homer’s story. On the contrary, the Trojans were worthy enough for the great Alexander to officially renew his mythological kinship and give them some advantages. Many of the cities with which the Macedonian army came into contact had mythological links to Alexander because they were founded by settlers from Argos. Important examples are Aspendos in Pamphylia, Soli and Mallus in Cilicia. Looking at the two previous examples, we might expect that Alexander would invoke this link whenever he could. Yet when we look at these specific cases, it is quite clear that his only happened when it suited him. Both Soli and Mallus had paid tribute to the Persian kings in the past. The inhabitants of Soli were punished for this by Alexander in 334/3 BC with a Macedonian garrison and a fine of 200 talents, while the Mallians were spared because of their common descent from the Argives. It is unclear why one city was punished and not the other, but Ian Bosworth’s suggestion that Mallus’ geographical position – it was much further east than Soli – may have played a role is an interesting explanation. Sometimes the roles were also reversed, with cities using a shared mythological link with Alexander to their own advantage. An example of this comes from Thebes. When a rumor circulated in Greece in 335 BC that the king had died, the city decided to revolt. However, as a member of the Corinthian League, which had been founded under Philip and united the ‘independent’ Greek poleis under the Macedonian hegemon, this rebellion violated the agreements made during the Common Peace of 391 BC. Alexander returned to Greece and led the discussion as hegemon of the league about the measures to be taken against Thebes. During this discussion, a Theban prisoner is said to have spoken, pleading for mercy on the basis that the city was traditionally seen as the birthplace of Herakles. This plea fell on deaf ears and it was decided to raze the city to the ground. Apparently, Herakles’ lineage was only useful if it was advantageous to Alexander. This is not surprising since this was already a conclusion we could draw from the examples of two poleis that came into contact. The more Alexander moved eastwards, the less he relied on kinship ties. The next examples we get are from India. However, he had opportunities enough though: in Tyre in Lebanon Melcart was worshipped, a god who was equated with Herakles and in Egypt Alexander was named son of Zeus-Amon by the oracle in Siwa. However, there are no traces that he invoked his famous ancestors in any of these examples, probably because these figures were less and less known to the local population. Alexander therefore sought other means of connecting with the local population: for example, he increasingly combined Persian and Macedonian clothing and married daughters of the Persian kings Darius and Artaxerxes III, rather than invoking a distant shared connection through the Greek hero Perseus. It is therefore extremely surprising that examples can be found from India. According to Arrian, there was again a kinship in the case of the city of Nysa, which would have been founded by Dionysus (Arr. 5.1.). If Alexander went beyond this city, he had thus achieved more than the god. This episode – and also other examples from India – are problematic, however, because they were viewed with skepticism in antiquity and there is no tradition to support these stories. Furthermore, it also seems highly unlikely that the Greek gods and heroes traditionally invoked were known in these areas. It is possible, of course, that in this case Alexander invented the myth of a foundation by Dionysus to enhance his own divine status. In that case he had deviated very far from the traditional customs surrounding kinship myth and the tradition as it existed among the Greek polis in and around the Mediterranean. However, it is clear that Alexander was very familiar with this tradition and he could easily adapt it to his own needs throughout his campaigns. Further reading: Lee E.

In the last two contributions, I have paid extensive attention to the figure of Alexander the Great and we have looked at which mythological ancestors the Macedonian king had and how this descent can still be seen in material sources. In this last part on Alexander the Great, I think it is high time to look at how Alexander used this mythological lineage during his conquests. The use of mythological affiliations between two parties was already a regular part of the Greek diplomatic toolbox before the start of the Hellenistic period. This means that Alexander was very familiar with this phenomenon and could use it frequently during his military campaigns. Most examples of this date from the early years of his travels and come from Greeks or Asia Minor where Alexander seems to have followed a long tradition. The best-known example comes from Thessaly where, shortly after the death of Philippus in 336 BC, Alexander sought to nip local resistance in the bud.

Little to no sewing was involved. Another piece of fabric was generally worn overtop as a type of cloak (himation). People would often go barefoot, but leather sandals were also worn. There are a few distinct styles we can observe, each with its own set of variations. Here we will briefly discuss three of the most prominent in women’s clothing. The Chiton (often classified into Doric or Ionic) was made of a long rectangular piece of fabric, which was fastened together at the shoulders. It was sometimes paired with a girdle at the ribs, and a himation overtop. The himation was yet another cloth rectangle, which was draped over the body in various ways, often like a cloak or sometimes even a veil. Peplos Kore ca. 530 BC. Similarly, the Peplos also constituted of a long rectangular material but was then folded and hung at the shoulders, creating the appearance of multiple pieces being draped. A girdle or belt was often worn at the waist. This style of women’s garnet is depicted in famous statues such as the Peplos Kore and is often depicted as being worn by Athena. c.530B.C. Peplos Kore. Production: So, we have a better picture of the way Greek clothing was worn, but how was it produced? We can observe the use of the warp-weighted loom from Bronze Age Greece, and the procedure stayed the same up through the Hellenistic period. Fabrics were often woven either at home or in a workshop by groups of women. It would begin by processing various fibres through a means of retting, washing, and combing. The fibres were then spun by a weighted spindle and woven from top to bottom on the loom. Here we can see the 2ndcentury rhetorician Pollux describing the equipment used for Spinning and Weaving: “In a few words one can pull together the rest of those items that pertain to the women’s quarters: woven baskets and baskets with narrow bottoms and the smaller types of both.. and the spindle and the circular whorls, the skeins of yarn, the weaver’s shuttle, and the comb of the loom; and the weaver’s rod [to attach the alternate threads of the warp] and the beam along with the vertical beams of the loom [between which the web is stretched]; and the stone weights [for the warp threads] and the loom weights, and the flat blade [to strike the weft threads home].” (Pollux, Lexicon 10.124-125) Amasis, 6th cent. B.C. c.560 B.C. Lekythos: Reverse: Women Working Wool: Two views. Place: Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.) While Greece is often depicted as a land dotted with stark white marble architecture, and people wandering about in simple white togas, it was far more colorful than that. Temples and statues were brightly painted, and clothing was also treated in similar regard. Dyed fabrics, of course, were more expensive, so bright colors were often associated with wealth. The disadvantaged Greeks would make do with whatever undyed fabrics they could afford, and many of them worked in facilities that produced these colorful dyes. One of the most expensive and sought-after colors was Tyrian purple. This dye was made from the secretion of various snail species often referred to as ‘murex’ snails. It was labour intensive and required many snails to produce a dye, therefore required murex production facilities. These places were often quoted as being notoriously smelly.

So when I was at the Altes Museum in Berlin last week, I noticed that whenever Alexander the Great is represented in archaeological and numismatic sources, there are references to mythology and divine elements. As we have already seen, the use of mythology was an important element in Alexander’s politics. We now know that he claimed to be descended from two Greek heroes: Achilles on the mother’s side and Heracles on the father’s. References to this mythological lineage are not only found in written sources. This month, therefore, we turn our attention to the representation of Alexander in sculpture and to the coins issued in his name. There are several busts and statues of Alexander that have survived to this day, but how is he depicted? Alexander conquered the world at a young age and died before he was 35. The image of the young dynamic king – often with idealised facial features – was therefore the one most used by Hellenistic and Roman sculptors when depicting Alexander. A second striking element – which, incidentally, would have a great influence on later Hellenistic kings – is the fact that Alexander allowed himself to be depicted without a beard. His father, Philippus II, had chosen to follow the tradition of the Greeks and to be immortalised with a full beard. Alexander’s choice not to do this thus ensured on the one hand that he broke with the traditions of his father and at the same time allowed him to imitate young Greek heroes such as Heracles and Achilles or gods like Dionysus, who were often depicted without a beard. The connection to Herakles is even more obvious in a rather battered bust from the National Archaeological Museum in Athens where Alexander can be seen with the lion’s head on his head like his mythological ancestor. The diadochoi or successors of Alexander eagerly followed his example and they too were often depicted young, idealised and with certain typical features. The most important element of a Hellenistic king’s image was the diadem. This was a thin band of white cloth worn on the head and, according to some, invented by the god Dionysus and symbolising the conquest of new territories. This association with Dionysus was important because as a god he had conquered the East, as had Alexander and his retinue. Other connections to Alexander and his divine ancestors were also imitated, for example, in the Louvre there is a bust of the formidable Roman enemy Mithradates VI on which he is wearing a lion’s head. A clear reference to Alexander’s Heraklian ancestry. Besides the marble heads and statues of Alexander, he was also posthumously immortalised on the coins of some of his successors. On a silver tetradrachm struck during the reign of Lysimachos between 308 and 281 BC, the head of Alexander can be seen. It is striking that, in addition to the typical Hellenistic diadem, the Macedonian king also clearly has horns on his head, a clear reference to the Egyptian son Ammon, of whom Alexander also claimed to be the son. Another important coin associated with Alexander and very well known are the so-called Herakles coins. These were minted by both Alexander himself and posthumously in his name by his successors. The silver coins show Alexander’s ancestor Heracles on the obverse, easily recognised by the lion skin on his head. On the reverse, the Greek supreme god Zeus is shown, who, as the father of Heracles, also has a direct connection to Alexander. This brief overview shows that the way Alexander was depicted – both himself and by others – was permeated with references to his mythological origin and divine status as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Moreover, the traditions started under Alexander were carried on by the various Hellenistic kingdoms. It is clear, then, that the link between mythology and politics is not only to be found in diplomatic relations but can also be drawn further to visual representations of Alexander. This is already the seventh post in a series of twelve which dives into the ways in which the ancient Greeks used their mythological past as a diplomatic tool in their relationships with others.

So when I was at the Altes Museum in Berlin last week, I noticed that whenever Alexander the Great is represented in archaeological and numismatic sources, there are references to mythology and divine elements. As we have already seen, the use of mythology was an important element in Alexander’s politics. We now know that he claimed to be descended from two Greek heroes: Achilles on the mother’s side and Heracles on the father’s. References to this mythological lineage are not only found in written sources. This month, therefore, we turn our attention to the representation of Alexander in sculpture and to the coins issued in his name.

The archaeological site of Megalopolis lies in the heart of the Arcadian region in Greece and is about a 45 minute drive from modern day Sparta. Not many of the buildings from the ancient city remain, but you can still see the columns of the Philippeion, remnants of a temple for Zeus and sit on the remaining seats at the largest theatre in the Peloponnese. But what history lies behind these ruins? Megalopolis was founded by the Arkadian koinon (or league) in 368 BC through a synoicism of many different communities that now found themselves forced to live in the polis and which needed to come together as one city. It has often been said that the city had been founded as the capital for the Arkadian league, but this theory seems highly unlikely. The main reason for the city’s foundation was actually the Arkadian need to protect the southern part of the region against the looming threat of Sparta and its frequent invasions of the border areas. As a result, the Megalopolitan identity was characterized throughout its history by a strong antagonism towards Sparta which was only fueled by its close geographical proximity to Sparta. The countless attacks on the city by the Lacedaemonians – one of which was so severe in 227 BC that it took several years to rebuild the polis – can still be detected in the archaeological remains. Due to its size, it was easy for the city to become an influential member of the Arkadian koinon to which it contributed ten of the fifty federal damiorgoi (IG V 2.1, l. 23-33). After the dissolution of the Arkadian federation in 363 BC, the city remained politically active in its native region and the Peloponnese. In fact, the polis’ decade-long alliance with the Macedonian kings was formed in the period after Philip II of Macedon gave several Spartan regions to Megalopolis soon after the battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. The Megalopolitan loyalty to Macedon is a second characteristic of the city’s local identity that had a far-reaching influence on Megalopolitan politics. For one, it was strong enough for the citizens to dedicate one of the biggest buildings on their agora, a monumental stoa of ca. 160 meters, to Philip II. Moreover, it allowed the polis’ two only tyrants to come to power in the 270s and 250s BC: Aristodamos the Good and Lydiadas. While only a handful of literary sources talk about the two tyrants, one of them played a crucial part in the history of Megalopolis. By 235 BC, the Achaians had become a genuine threat to Megalopolis, so both Lydiades and the citizens most likely thought that joining the Achaian koinon was a good course of action. This decision proved beneficial, as the polis quickly rose to a prominent position within the federation. In many ways, Megalopolis was a typical member of the Achaian koinon: it minted federal coinage, was represented in the federal institutions, hosted assembly meetings after 188 BC and a considerable number of influential Achaian statesmen were Megalopolitan. The way in which Megalopolis influenced the Achaian foreign politics can be detected throughout the polis’ federal membership. In the 220s BC, Megalopolis as a city was responsible for the first connections between the Achaians and the Macedonian king Antigonos during the Kleomenean War. However, after the Achaian synodos of 198 BC, the koinon abandoned their alliance with Philip V of Macedon in favour of Rome, and the nature of the Megalopolitan influence shifted from the civic level to the individual one as a result of the rise of important individuals from Megalopolis within Achaian federal politics, including Philopoimen and Lykortas. The polis remained a member of the Achaian koinon until its destruction by the Romans in 146 BC and was inhabited well into the Roman period. However, when Pausanias visited the city in the second century AD, a lot of the buildings and sanctuaries had fallen into ruin (Paus. 8. 30-32).

Situated just off of the coast of the northern Nile Delta, Pharos’ harbors offered a strategic interconnectedness between the Greek and Near Eastern worlds. In surveying the city that would hold his namesake, Alexander the Great found Homer’s words to ring true. Just as Menelaus commented on the quality of Pharos’ harbors, Alexander knew that this site would one day be the epicenter of the ancient world. Head of Alexander, Acropolis Museum Alexander began his reign as king with campaigns that stretched far from his home in Macedonia to the heart of the Persian Empire, a journey that allowed him to make a name for himself as he conquered various Persian territories along the way. His campaigns brought him to the neighboring land of Egypt, a thriving society despite the harsh effects of the previous Persian occupation. As the figure that fended off the Persian shah, Alexander experienced a warm welcome from the Egyptians who viewed him as their “liberator” and worthy of the land’s successive kingship. The opportunity present in this land was evident. Egypt had access to valuable resources such as gold and grain and benefited from the seasonal surplus of food supplied by the Nile’s irrigated fields. Pharos was uniquely, yet strategically, located just offshore from the already settled village of Rhakotis. To the south lay Lake Mareotis which was fed further by the Nile, offering an additional mode of importing goods. Alexander and his architects found that by constructing a narrow causeway from Pharos to the mainland, they could create two harbors, thus allowing greater access for ships entering from different directions. Such a consideration was necessary in order to accommodate for the subsequent traffic that would follow the reputation of Alexander’s expansive empire. And so Alexander’s men went to work emptying sacks of barley flour to lay out the plans of the city. To their surprise, they were met with the ravenous hunger of flocks of birds who quickly made waste of their supplies. As a society that paid close attention to omens, many viewed this as an immediate sign of the impending failure of this endeavor. Nevertheless, Alexander’s personal soothsayer eased this fear by noting that the birds were merely an indication of the city’s capacity to feed the world. Despite the land’s rich agricultural resources, the “feeding” referenced in the prediction would actually result in an enrichment of the mind as opposed to one’s appetite. Though Alexander would not live to see the full extent of the city’s success, Alexandria became the heart, or rather brain, of the ancient world as it brought together philosophers, mathematicians, and physicians in one central location of learning.

And how could they not? His deeds have captured the imagination for millennia. Whether it is his extremely fast march to India or the ease with which he inspired loyalty in his soldiers and loved ones: generals, historians, heads of state and many others have sought their inspiration from this Macedonian king. In fact, the hype around Alexander and his person is so great that sometimes the line between the real man and the myth surrounding him is very fine. But what does he have to do with this series on myth and polis? A few weeks ago, I read the following statement on Twitter: ‘Alexander the Great was actually a woman and the male writers of antiquity concealed this fact in order to negate her achievements’. While I greatly admire the creativity behind this and find the idea of Alexandra the Great an interesting concept, I think it is safe to say one of the certainties we have about Alexander the Great is that he was a man and reigned as King of Macedon. The image of Alexander that has come to us is a combination of many different elements: the interpretation of his deeds and personality in the literary sources – which were made several centuries after the real man lived -, his image on the tetradrachms of the diadochs and various busts that have been preserved. But Alexander’s image of himself also changed according to the context. He easily assumed different guises according to the people he wanted to conquer during his march throughout the former Persian Empire. Think of the ease with which he took on the mantle of the son of Ammon in the episode at the oracle of Siwah as part of his legitimate recognition as the new pharaoh of Egypt. Myth and mythological affiliations play an important role in the creation of this image of Alexander the Great. As we have already seen in several examples of the last articles, Alexander the Great also used his descent from well-known mythological figures to facilitate the conquest of certain cities and territories. After all, it was a good alternative to yet another military campaign and the violence that went with it. Alexander’s use of the kinship myth therefore had a pragmatic edge to it and was mainly used when the context and the target audience allowed it. Alexander was smart enough to realise that invoking mythological relationships through Greek mythological heroes and gods made little sense among non-Greek peoples, who were completely unfamiliar with this custom. There are, however, some examples from India and other non-Greek peoples where Alexander does invoke this tradition. So which kinships did Alexander rely on? There are actually two major lines of kinship that existed before this birth. On his father’s side he would have been descended from Heracles through Perdiccas, a descendant of Temenos, a famous king of Argos and the great-grandson of Hyllos, the grandson of Heracles (Diod. 17.4.1.) The founder of Alexander’s dynasty, Alexander I (497-454 BC) already claimed this when he participated in the Olympic Games in 496 and it was never really questioned after that. On his mother’s side he would be descended from Achilles. Alexander’s mother Olympias came from Epirus, where the Molossian dynasty ruled. They found the origin of their dynasty in the figure of Neoptolemos, the son of Achilles, who ended up in Epirus after the Trojan War with Andromache, the wife of Hector (Just. 11.3.1-2). They would also have derived the name of their dynasty from the son of Neoptolemos and Andromache, Molossos. As if this were not enough, the following idea also came about during Alexander’s conquests: he was in fact the son of Zeus, which was confirmed by the oracle of Ammon – who could be equated with Zeus. With such an impressive arsenal of mythological ancestors, it should come as no surprise that Alexander made eager use of them when it helped him achieve his ultimate goal: the creation of one great multicultural empire.

From these examples, a few things become very clear. We do know that these kinship ties were used as an effective effective means of achieving certain goals, but do we know which ties where used and, more importantly, who these stories were meant to convince? In this next article, we are going to see to what extent we can find out who was active behind the scenes and what these claims were usually based on. In the last contribution I mainly looked at the literary sources, but given the size and the nature of the epigraphic material, it provides us with more opportunities to find an answer. As mentioned earlier, there are more examples of kinship myth in the inscriptions than those of classical authors. An additional advantage of these epigraphic texts is that they did not come to us through an additional intermediary. However subjective these texts may seem, we can see them in the way the way the authors wanted them to be seen. As far as their state of preservation allows this, of course. If we put the inscriptions side by side which speak of sungenēs/sungeneia or oikeios/oikeiotēs, it is clear that we often know what the results of a specific request were, but not how it came about. Fortunately, there are a few rare inscriptions that can help us. A first example in which allows us a small glimpse behind the scenes of this of this diplomatic tradition is an epigraphic text from the second century BC, IC I.XXIV.1. It is part of a series of inscriptions from the Ionian town of Teos in which the inhabitants of Crete acknowledge the city asylos. Many of these inscriptions use the typical Greek terms of kinship with which we have become familiar in this series. In this particular inscription a rhapsode named Menecles is praised by his home town of Teos for his appearance before the public assembly of one of the cities of Crete. In this performance Menecles sang of local myths from Crete as well as works of famous poets such as Timotheus of Miletus. The purpose of this performance was of course to reveal the mythological link between Teos and the inhabitants of Crete but the text does not say what those specific examples were. What is interesting is that the inscription tells us that the poet performed for the people’s assembly. This was also the seat of the ordinary’ citizens, not all of whom were familiar with the obscure stories of unknown mythological heroes and family ties sometimes mentioned in past examples. The fact that Menecles’ performance could charm and perhaps convince them to vote for the asylia of Teos, is shown by his veneration in the same inscription. The importance of the public assembly or ekklesia in the making of political and administrative decisions is also shown by numerous other epigraphic texts. The form of government of most poleis during the Hellenistic period was also democratic and so it could certainly be that it was the citizens of the city who during the meetings of the ekklisia had to be convinced. It is important to note that this text is only one very specific example and certainly a general conclusion cannot be drawn, but it does offer us an an interesting opportunity to think about. What we can say with a little more certainty is that the basis for many of the mythological links in the Hellenistic period (and to some extent before that) can be sought in existing local mythological traditions. These local myths were in many cases adapted in order to make possible family connections easier to form. If we look back for a moment to the example of Magnesia on the Meander in IV Magnesia 35 which was extensively discussed in the third contribution of this series. In this text it is mentioned for the first time that Magnes, the hero and founder of the city, is the son of Aeolus. Through this link the inhabitants of Magnesia could easily claim their mythological kinship with the Same on the island of Kefalonia. Until then Magnes was a figure already known in Greek mythology but whose father was not Aeolus. The fact that in the Greek world there were often different versions of certain myths is perhaps no surprise. For example, there are different birthplaces for the gods: Asclepius was born in Doris according to one regional tradition, while another other gives birth to him in Epidauros. The ultimate source that juxtaposes several of these traditions is the historian Pausanias. In his Periegesis, he describes not only the numerous monuments of the cities he visits, but also the local stories and legends about the creation of the cities. Sometimes different versions of the origins of commonly known mythological characters emerge, making it clear that the Greek cities, in creating their foundation myths, did not hesitate to bend these stories to their will in order to fit their own local identity into the Greek world. These mythological heroes and their deeds were an ideal tool because the broad outlines of their actions were known throughout the Greek-speaking world, but often remained so vaguely defined that the details could be adapted without too much trouble to fit one’s own local identity into the wider mythological framework. It seems only logical that the same technique was used by cities during the Hellenistic period (and before) to support so-called vague affinity claims. Thus, although we often do not know what arguments were used by the Greeks to assert their kinship with a particular city or individual, it seems logical that the local myths, heroes and stories of a city played a role in this.

Previously I have outlined how the Greeks had a whole arsenal of traditions that were used in Greek diplomacy. Referring to a common, mythological kinship between two parties was only one of the ways the Greeks tried to persuade others to join their cause. Looking at the two examples already discussed, this phenomenon seems to be purely Hellenistic. But was it really? A large part of sources that mention these so-called mythological affiliations, are inscriptions from the Hellenistic period. During the Hellenistic world more Greek texts were engraved on stone than in the Classical and Archaic periods. This was, of course, because in addition to the poleis on the Greek mainland, now cities on the coasts of Asia Minor and the Cyclades wanted to play a role in international politics and immortalized successful diplomatic actions on the on the agora of their city. This abundance of epigraphic sources – I may be speaking of an abundance here, but compared to modern historians we are still talking about a fairly small number of number of sources – can sometimes give the impression that the use of mythological kinship as a diplomatic tool occurred only in the period after the death of Alexander the Great. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Kinship claims had long played a role in Greek diplomacy. Thus, there are also examples can be found in Greek authors such as Herodotos and Thucydides, which makes it clear that this was a tradition that existed long before the inhabitants of Kythinion relied on some strange ancestor to get money to build their new wall. When we compare the two types of sources, some interesting elements emerge. For example, kinship in the literary sources is used more as an argument in cases of the forming of alliances, requesting assistance or justifying the conquest or occupation of a particular territory. The inscriptions mainly concern requests for asylia, recognition for religious festivals or political interactions between two states. In general, the literary examples are also somewhat more dramatic and mention – coincidentally or not – also some well-known historical figures such as the Persian king Xerxes. This is in all probably also due to the need of these authors to attract the attention of their audience. About time, then, to take a look at some examples. A first example can be found in Herodotos. In his Histories (7.150) he mentions the following story. During the Persian Wars Xerxes was preparing his invasion of Greece, when he sent a request to the inhabitants of the Greek city of Argos with the request to remain neutral during the upcoming war. He supported this request with the reference to a kinship relationship between the Persians and the Argives. The Persians, in fact, were said to be descended from Perses, the son of Perseus, the famous mythological hero from Argos. On that basis Xerxes concluded that the Argives were the ancestors of the Persians. This passage provides an interesting example as it involves kinship ties between a non-Greek people and a Greek city. It seems very unlikely that Xerxes really addressed himself to Argos. First, although the chance exists that the Persians had some knowledge of Greek mythology, there are no Persian sources that support this idea. Second, there is also the question of whether Argos around 480 BC was politically and militarily strong enough to warrant such a demand from Xerxes. Whatever the exact reason for this passage may be, it implies the existence of a broader tradition in the Greek world in which so-called synegeneia could be used as a valid argument could be used in diplomatic interactions at the time of Herodotos. A second example we find with the author Plutarch. Writing in the second century AD, he tells of the conflict between Athens and Megara over the island of Salamis in the sixth century B.C. According to Plutarch, both poleis had been fighting over the island for decades. When Sparta acted as mediator to resolve the conflict, both the Athenians and the inhabitants of Megara used mythology as a means of justifying the conquest of Salamis (Plut. Sol. 10). Athens cited, among other things, that the sons of Ajax, the Homeric hero who came from Salamis, became Athenian citizens became and had left the island to the city had left the island to the city. Because Salamis eventually became Athenian property, Megara afterwards tried to strengthen their territorial claim by creating a local hero named Sciron with Salamis through the figure of Ajax. Regardless of the historical reliability of this passage – the large time span between author and event causes the necessary historiographical problems – this example also shows how important mythological relationships could be for the Greeks. Sometimes the inheritance of a particular territory from the son of a Homeric hero such as Ajax, was apparently a good enough argument to gain control of that area and this happened centuries before the arrival of the Hellenistic kingdoms.

This is in all probably also due to the need of these authors to attract the attention of their audience. About time, then, to take a look at some examples. A first example can be found in Herodotos. In his Histories (7.150) he mentions the following story. During the Persian Wars Xerxes was preparing his invasion of Greece, when he sent a request to the inhabitants of the Greek city of Argos with the request to remain neutral during the upcoming war. He supported this request with the reference to a kinship relationship between the Persians and the Argives.

On that basis Xerxes concluded that the Argives were the ancestors of the Persians. This passage provides an interesting example as it involves kinship ties between a non-Greek people and a Greek city. It seems very unlikely that Xerxes really addressed himself to Argos. First, although the chance exists that the Persians had some knowledge of Greek mythology, there are no Persian sources that support this idea. Second, there is also the question of whether Argos around 480 BC was politically and militarily strong enough to warrant such a demand from Xerxes. Whatever the exact reason for this passage may be, it implies the existence of a broader tradition in the Greek world in which so-called synegeneia could be used as a valid argument could be used in diplomatic interactions at the time of Herodotos.

Writing in the second century AD, he tells of the conflict between Athens and Megara over the island of Salamis in the sixth century B.C. According to Plutarch, both poleis had been fighting over the island for decades. When Sparta acted as mediator to resolve the conflict, both the Athenians and the inhabitants of Megara used mythology as a means of justifying the conquest of Salamis (Plut. Sol. 10) Athens cited, among other things, that the sons of Ajax, the Homeric hero who came from Salamis, became Athenian citizens became and had left the island to the city had left the island to the city. Because Salamis eventually became Athenian property, Megara afterwards tried to strengthen their territorial claim by creating a local hero named Sciron with Salamis through the figure of Ajax.

She was the fourth wife of the founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty but also the most important one as she was the mother of his successor Ptolemy II Philadelphus and his sister-wife Arsinoe II. While not much is known about her life, what we do know paints an interesting picture. Was she really the half-sister of Ptolemy I? Why did her son become Pharaoh and not one of Ptolemy’s older children? What was her connection to Magas the king of Cyrene? Large head from a limestone female statue, possibly Berenice I. (c) British Museum Born around 345 BC, Berenice was the daughter of Antigone, daughter of a Cassander and the niece of the Antipater. Her father was a Macedonian called Lagus or Magas. Nothing is known about Berenice’s youth and she first steps into the spotlight when she marries a Macedonian noble named Philip. This first marriage results in a son, Magas, and two daughters, Antigone and Theoxena. All of her children would have important roles in the administration and diplomacy of Ptolemaic Egypt as a result of their mother’s position as queen. Magas would eventually rule as the independent king of Cyrene, Antigone would marry Pyrrhus of Epirus and Theoxena married Agathocles the tyrant of Syracuse. It is unclear how exactly this Philip died, but by 322 BC Berenice had become a widow. When Antipater arranged the marriage of his daughter Eurydice to Ptolemy I, Berenice travelled with her to Egypt as her lady in waiting along with her children. The proposed union between his daughter and Ptolemy, was an attempt by Antipater to prevent the diadiochi from fighting against one another after Alexander’s death. Hoping to keep order and peace in Alexander’s former empire, Antipater married several of his daughters off to the most promising of of Alexander’s generals. Ptolemy and Eurydice ended up having several children: Ptolemy Ceraunos and Meleager among them. It is not clear exactly when Berenice and Ptolemy I became involved or married but if they were indeed half-siblings – this is actually not certain -, it is not unreasonable to see how they would be in contact. Berenice soon became a major figure at the Ptolemaic court. Apparently, Berenice was a woman who easily made a strong impression on someone. This is evidenced from a visit from Pyrrhus of Epirus to the Ptolemaic court in 297 BC. While he was there, he was so impressed by Berenice’s intelligence and influence that he allied himself with the Ptolemies through a marriage with Antigone, Berenice’s daughter. This action would only make sense if Berenice had a firm position in the Ptolemaic dynasty. Around 317 BC, Ptolemy made Berenice his second wife and their daughter Arsinoe II Philadelphus was born in 316 BC. They had another daughter Philotera and a son: Ptolemy II Philadephus, who would become the successor of his father. That the two enjoyed a affectionate relationship can be seen in Theocritus’ Idyll 17.34. as well as Plutarch’s life of Pyrrhus where he says this: ‘[Berenice] had the greatest influence of Ptolemy’s wives and surpassed the others in character and intellectual power. [Plut.Pyrr. 4]. A gold tetradrachm showing Berenice and Ptolemy as the saviour gods. (c) British Museum When Alexander’s successors started naming themselves kings, Ptolemy was no exception. Of course, Berenice’s opinion on this move is not recorded but most likely she stood behind this decision. Although there is no actual attestation about the influence of Berenice on her husband’s rule: the roles of her children in the relations with other states as well as the continuation of the Ptolemaic line offer us some insight into her status. All of her daughters were married to important allies of the kingdom: Lysimachos, Agathocles and Pyrrhus. Her son Magas would rule Cyrene for Ptolemy, while her other would become his ultimate successor as the second ruler of the Ptolemaic dynasty. When this decision was made around 290-285 BC, Eurydice left Egypt for good. Berenice died around 275 BC, she was deified by her son Ptolemy II together with her husband. They were known as the savior gods” who would secure the peace of Egypt and the fortunes of its royal house. In Alexandria, Berenice had her own temple and was merged with the goddess Aphrodite and received several offerings including a statue made of ivory and gold. As the most important of the wives of Ptolemy I, she helped build the traditions of the Ptolemaic dynasty, while serving as the arch-type of the Ptolemaic queen: a strong woman who was actively involved in the political climate of the empire she helped rule.

On the Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, you can find posts dedicated to some of the most influential and famous women, but here on the website we are shining some light on a few great women from the Hellenistic Period. After Apama, the first queen of the Seleucids, guest blogger Hebe Kearney introduces us to Nossis, a female poet who lived in the third century BC. Nossis was a female poet from Locris in Southern Italy [Balmer, 3]. She wrote in Greek and lived during the first half of the third century BCE [Balmer, 3; Licciardello, 435; Skinner (1991) and (2002), 69; Snyder, 77]. Eleven of her epigrams survive, and convey a strong poetic voice and interest in women’s lives and experiences, with eight of the eleven having women as subjects, and three mentioning Nossis herself by name.[Skinner (1991): 5; Snyder, 77]. There are also four references to Aphrodite, with the goddess positioned as a patron and inspiration for female poetic creation.[Skinner (2002) 63; Aphrodite often has a similar role in Sappho, and is mentioned in fourteen fragments]. Nossis was recognised even in antiquity for her focus on women, being awarded the epithet ‘θηλύγλωσσος’/‘thelyglossos’ by Antipater of Thessalonica [On the use of this epithet see: Skinner (1989): 14; Skinner (1991): 22; Rowland, 120] This epithet means essentially ‘one who spoke like a woman’ [Translation of the epithet here is following Skinner’s (1991): 22] The epithet is widely accepted as signalling Nossis’ poetic interest in and focus on women [Rowland, 120; Skinner (1991), 20; 22] Nossis, then, was a poet concerned with depicting women and women’s experiences. Bust of Nossis made by Francesco Jerace in 1920 (c) Wikimedia Commons To demonstrate Nossis’s poetic skill and self-proclaimed female poetic voice, let’s look at her poem In this poem, Nossis boldly declares that her poetry is woman-centred and highly skilled: ‘O stranger, if you indeed sail in the direction of Mytilene and its beautiful dances, because you are inspired by the blossoming of Sappho’s graces, say that the land of Locris bore one beloved both by her and the Muses, and having learned that my name is Nossis: go!’ [Greek sourced from Paton (1917): 382-383; Translation is the author’s] Sappho was a Greek poet who lived during the sixth century BC in Mytilene, a city on the island of Lesbos. She composed poetry about and for women, including love poetry. Her work was widely known and celebrated in antiquity, and she was hailed as ‘the tenth muse’. Her reputation has extended into modern times, and the terms ‘Sapphic’ and ‘lesbian’ are derived from her name and homeland respectively. In AP 7.718, Nossis uses her to symbolise female-authored poetry: she is positioned as the head of a female poetic tradition which Nossis claims to belong to. The poem lies within the Greek genre of ‘epitaphic’ poetry, which imitates inscriptions on tombstones. Often these poems are, like actual inscriptions, addressed to the reader on behalf of a deceased person. However, in AP. 7.718 there is no death, and the message is to be sent to Mytilene, not back to Nossis’s home in Locris. Instead of any mention of Nossis’ family or marital status, as one would expect, there is instead reference to Sappho. This poem therefore portrays female poetics as of central importance to Nossis’s life and identity. Nossis is proud of her poetic skill, and is not afraid to proclaim that this skill is influenced by and focused on women. Nossis is therefore an interesting and important figure. Not only is she one of the few female poets from Greco-Roman antiquity whose work survives, but she is one that boldly embraces and celebrates her gender. Her work suggests that women writers in the Hellenistic period were aware of other women writers who came before them, and felt a connection to them across time. Nossis’s voice comes across to us as self-assured, triumphant even. This shows us that some women in antiquity were able to excel at pursuits normally dominated by men. Despite pervasive oppression that women in Greco-Roman antiquity faced, they were still at times able to create, feel solidarity with other women, and to celebrate this.

His successors and their wives are named, and 80 or so officers of high rank were given noble Persian wives as well. All soldiers received monetary gifts to celebrate or settle debts [Arr. 4.4-6]. Most of these unions at of the mass wedding at Susa did not last very long, yet there was one exception: the marriage between Seleucos I Nikator (more about him here) and his wife Apama. In this first part of the series on Hellenistic Women, Zofia Guertin – from the archaeoartist blog, art and website as well as the Two Friends Talk History Podcast – tells us more about the first queen of the Seleucid dynasty. The mass wedding at Susa is a curious event and to understand why Alexander the Great was playing match-maker, it is worth considering what transpired leading up to this epic wedding party. Following Alexander’s conquest of the Punjab and Indus valley where his armies carried out brutal occupation tactics from 327-325 BCE, Alexander was met with the first real resistance from his men at the Hyphasis River in 326 BCE: the soldiers had had enough and would go no further Half of the army was sent to Susa with Nearchus by sea, the other half followed Alexander through the Gedrosian desert (south-west Pakistan), inland from the ocean. This 60-day march cost the lives of 12,000 soldiers as wells as livestock, camp followers – with wives and children among them – and many of the captured goods. Early the next year, Alexander sent 10,000 Macedonian veterans home with Craterus, to be replaced by new levies of men. Not only was there a need for new blood but some new ways of connection were necessary to this area which was shaping up as the new center of his power. Alexander’s soldiers had come a long way and their hopes to return home one day were not necessarily helpful. Sensing the way the wind was blowing, Alexander planned a great wedding to ensure some further incentives for his men to stay with him in the empire he was creating. The lavish ceremony at Susa was a pragmatic approach to create bonds between the conquerors and their territories. One of his most trusted generals, Seleucus I, was married to the Bactrian-Sogdian noblewoman, Apama. Arrian tells us that Apama was one of the daughters of Spitamenes, who had originally opposed Alexander and his forces, and was killed by nomadic allies with his head being sent to Alexander as a peace offering. Alexander married daughters of Darius and Artaxerxes to solidify himself as the incontestable ruler of the Persian empire, though this did not last long. With his death the following year, the conquered territories were split between the most powerful of his Successors, Seleucus being one of them. He took control over all of the eastern part of Alexander’s empire, founding the Seleucid dynasty. Unlike all of his former colleagues, he kept his Iranian wife, Apama. Apama became a prominent feature of his building programmes. Their son, Antiochus, was educated in the Greek language and customs of his father and also the Iranian customs of his mother, bridging their cultures to effectively rule a culturally and ethnically diverse territory [Engels & Erickson, 2016]. It was common for Hellenistic kings to found cities named after their wives, parents or children, and Seleucus named three cities in Apama’s honour, the most well-known of which is Apama on the Orontes, in Syria. This city continued to be a significant beacon of Syro-Hellenic culture for centuries which we can see through the archaeological remains still visible today. A picture of Apama drawn by ArchaeoArtist – Zofia Guertin! It is very likely that it was through Apama’s cultural connections to the Persian elite, that Seleucus was able to govern so effectively and successfully found the Seleucid Empire and dynasty. For the same reasons that Alexander married Persian nobility to legitimise his claim to govern the former-Achaemenid Empire, Seleucus would need a similar legitimate claim to the throne. Her status as the daughter of the famous Spitamenes – a symbolically potent figure for resisting Alexander’s conquest – was not incongruous with her governing alongside a Macedonian and his forces. Apama would have been familiar with all of the necessary cultural customs of the Persian elite, perhaps even drawing loyalties formerly to her father to the benefit of her husband and herself. It remains debated if Apama and Seleucus’ second wife, Stratonice, lived together as concurrent queens. Stratonice was a princess of the Antigonid dynasty of Macedonia, the daughter of King Demetrius, and granddaughter of Antipater, the general and advisor to Phillip II and Alexander the Great. It is generally agreed that, if the two queens were concurrent, Apama would have retained her status as the more powerful queen [Austin, 2005, 51]. It is unknown when Apama died, but it is believed to be after Seleucus’ marriage to Stratonice. Stratonice developed a close relationship with her stepson, Antiochus, who was her age. Though she had born a child to Seleucus, it became evident that his heir was enamoured of his young wife, Seleucus gave Stratonice to Antiochus in marriage in 294 BCE in a seemingly peaceful transition. Stratonice ruled alongside Antiochus for 33 years bearing him five children. Though Apama’s voice in all of these events is silent, she was a remarkable woman who survived the initial conquests of the Macedonians, became a displaced person in war and forced into marriage to the very people who invaded her country, survived the wars of the Successors and went on to found the Seleucid Empire with her husband.

Though the invasion of Alexander the Great and the Macedonian army into the Punjab in 327 BC was something of a bloody introduction, it marked a radical shift in the level of interaction between the cultures of Greece and India, which would continue throughout the Hellenistic period. Today’s Guest writer Derek – from the brilliant Hellenistic Age Podcast – shines some much needed light on the interactions between these two cultures. Alexander’s empire would not last beyond his death, neither among his generals nor in distant India. While the Successors would duke it out and carve out their own kingdoms, India was undergoing a radical change in the political landscape thanks to an ambitious and talented young leader named Chandragupta Maurya (r. 321-295 BC) who forged an empire that united much of the subcontinent. The first meeting between the Hellenistic kings and Chandragupta was far from peaceful. Seleucus I Nicator (r.312-281), founder of the Syrian-based dynasty that bears his name, had embarked on a campaign of reconquest and consolidation of several of Alexander’s eastern satrapies between 306-303 BC [Appian, Syrian Wars, 55; Strabo 15.2.9; Justin 15.4.21]. By 305, Seleucus took an army across the Indus River and clashed with the forces of Chandragupta. We know almost nothing about the war, but some two years later a peace treaty was signed between the two parties that put an end to the fighting. The treaty itself seems to have three clauses: the first was a marriage alliance between the Seleucid and Mauryan dynasties, thought to have been either Chandragupta taking a Seleucid bride or an affirmation of the marriage rights between the Greek colonists and local Indian communities. The Greeks, being casteless Yavana (the Sanskrit word for “Ionian”, i.e. Greek), would otherwise be legally barred or at least be restricted from taking Indian wives [Kosmin, 32-34; Mairs, 111-112; Stoneman, 378-379]. The second would be the transfer of Seleucus’ easternmost territories like Gandhara and Arachosia to Chandraupta. Thirdly, Chandragupta would give 500 Indian Elephants (and, presumably, their handlers) that were trained for use in battle. The relatively unbalanced transfer suggests that the war may have ended in Chandragupta’s favor, but the elephants would play an invaluable role that helped determine the outcome of the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. A victory largely won by Seleucus’ generalship and use of elephants, which earned him the mocking nickname “Elephant King” [Plutarch, Dem. 25.4]. Carving of Chandragupta Maurya (c) आशीष भटनागर The Treaty on the Indus thus established a firm border between the Seleucids and the Maurya and inaugurated a period of peaceful diplomacy lasting for over a century between the Successor Kingdoms and the Mauryan Empire. We have a few individual anecdotes of gift-exchanges between both parties. Chandragupta had some of India’s flora and fauna delivered to Seleucus: specimens like plants acting as aphrodisiacs or anaphrodisiacs, and even a tiger, which Seleucus regifted to Athens much to the amazement of its populace [Athenaeus, 1.32, 13.57]. Conversely, Chandragupta’s successor Bindusara sent a “wish list” to Antiochus I, requesting wine, figs, and a philosopher. The first two were duly returned, but Antiochus declined the request for a philosopher on the grounds that it was “unlawful” [Athenaeus, 14.67]. This pattern of gift giving seems to have carried on even as the Mauryan Empire began to fragment. For when Antiochus III marched to India he reaffirmed a friendship with King Sophagasenus (Subhagasena), presumably an independent lord or a subordinate rajah of the Maurya, and 150 elephants were gifted to the Seleucid ruler [Polybius, 11.34]. Such exchanges and negotiations indicate a relationship of equals, rather than that of coercion and domination [Kosmin, 35]. Not only were gifts exchanged, but we also have records of diplomats moving between the Seleucid and Mauryan courts throughout the period. In the time of Bindusara, the Seleucids sent Daimachus of Platea, while Ptolemy II Philadelphus commissioned an agent named Dionysius to travel on his behalf. [Strabo, 2.1.9; Pliny, 6.21]. However, the most important and influential of all the Greek diplomats would be Megasthenes, a Seleucid official who would journey to the court of Chandragupta in the great city of Pataliputra (modern Patna) along the Ganges River around the turn of the 4th century. We know little about the man, but his extended stay in Pataliputra enabled him to document his observations in a work known simply as the Indica. Sadly, the work does not survive outside of quotations by later authors like Strabo and Pliny the Elder, and despite some criticisms from near-contemporary writers, it has been considered one of the most detailed and accurate writings on India from an outside source until the Medieval period. [For more, see Stoneman, 129-285]. Megasthenes described everything he could, ranging from the geography of the Ganges to the capture of elephants, and the inner workings of the Mauryan state. The purpose of the Indica has been debated, with some postulating that it was Megasthenes’ attempt to justify Seleucus’ withdrawal from India, while others argue that it was a form of field research in case the Seleucids decided to launch another invasion [Kosmin, 36-58; Kurht, A. and Sherwin-White, S., 97]. Whatever the case may be, it has proven to be of such value that many scholars continue to use it to reconstruct our knowledge on the Mauryan Empire by cross-examining it with another work of Indian origin, the Arthashastra, a treatise on statecraft traditionally thought to have been composed by Chandragupta’s political advisor Chanakya [Avari, 107-110; Jansari, 40-41] Image of the bilingual Edict VII by Ashoka. So far, most our sources on Greco-Indian diplomacy comes from Greek writers and historians. But one of the most interesting and tantalizing accounts comes from none other than the third Mauryan Emperor: Ashoka the Great. Ashoka was originally an extremely warlike ruler, but following his particularly violent conquest of the Kalingas along the western portion of the Bay of Bengal in the 260s BC, he became a prominent convert to Buddhism. To express his newfound faith and outlook on life, Ashoka ordered dozens of inscriptions to be carved into stone across the entirety of his empire, telling us as much about Ashoka’s spiritual journey as it laid down the tenets of his beliefs [Lahiri, 118-279]. Two of them are especially relevant: Edict VII, recovered in 1957 from Kandahar, Afghanistan, discusses the philosophy behind nonviolence and urges a halt or restriction on hunting and fishing [For the translation see Imaging, 2012]. The inscription was carved in two languages, Aramaic (the lingua franca for much of the Iranian Plateau and Near East) and Greek, indicating a significant population of Greeks living within Mauryan borders. A coin depicting one of the Greco-Bactrian kings, Eukratides I of Bactria The other important example is Edict XIII, where Ashoka demonstrates his commitment to spreading the teachings of the Dharma by sending emissaries to the great kings of the West: Antiyoga (Antiochus I/II of the Seleucid Empire), Tulamaya (Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt), Antekina (Antigonus II Gonatas of Macedon), Maka (Magas of Cyrene), and Alikyashudala (Alexander II of Epirus) [Hultzsch, 43-49]. Not only does it reflect Ashoka’s understanding of the political landscape of the mid-3rd century Mediterranean, but it also provides us one of the few tantalizing pieces of evidence that Buddhist missionaries were sent to the Greek-speaking world, although we have no other accounts of their journey or their fate. The political fragmentation of the Mauryan Empire following Ashoka’s death in 232 BC coincides with the gradual loss of Seleucid Central Asia. Byy 185 BC the Maurya dynasty would disappear, while the Seleucids found themselves increasingly restricted to Syria and the Near East. The time of embassies and gift-exchange between India and the Mediterranean powers would largely come to an end, though trade networks continued to flourish. Conversely, the collapse of Mauryan power created a power vacuum that the ambitious kings of Greco-Bactria were quick to fill. In the same vein as Alexander and Seleucus, Demetrius I (r. 200-180 BC) would invade the subcontinent and establish the so-called Indo-Greek kingdoms in northwest India and Pakistan, ushering in a new (and perhaps less peaceful) era of exchange and interaction.

Byy 185 BC the Maurya dynasty would disappear, while the Seleucids found themselves increasingly restricted to Syria and the Near East.

The first two parts of this series have already provided a first framework in which the central theme of this series – i.e. the use of mythology for political purposes – can be applied. So it is high time to see kinship diplomacy in action. For the first example turning our attention to the coast of Asia Minor. In 1890 a large amount of inscriptions was found by a German team of archaeologists in the ruins of the Ionian city of Magnesia on the Meander. Elke Close In 208 BC. the city wanted to have the local festival for Artemis Leukophryene (or Artemis with the white eyebrows) upgraded to a Panhellenic festival. An earlier attempt in 221 B.C. to do so, had been unsuccessful and fifteen years later the time was ripe to try again. In order to gain recognition for their festival, so-called theorodoi were sent to all corners of the Greek-speaking world. These messengers were often sent out during the organization of Panhellenic games often sent out to advertise, ask for recognition for the festival and to affirm the asylia or inviolability of a territory. In each city, the Magnesian envoys pleaded their case and kept track of the reactions. More than sixty decrees and letters, coming from both Greek poleis and Hellenistic kings, have been preserved, and were engraved on stelai on the walls of the agora. It is mainly these texts that are of interest to us. One glance at the collection clearly shows that a kinship claim with a particular city is one of the instruments which the Magnesian envoys fell back on to make their argument. In no less than twelve of the preserved responses, some sort of reference is made to a kinship between Magnesia and the city they were appealing to. For example, in one of the decrees, most likely drawn up by Mytilene or Eresus, the following vague reference can be read read: “the ambassadors of Magnesia invite our people, as friends and relatives, to participate participate in the sacrifice and the festival.’ (I. Magn. 52 16-19.). The kinship between Magnesia and the cities, however, was not in all cases so vague. Another example comes from the decree of Same, a city on the island of Kefalonia. In it it is stated that the visitors had explained that there was ‘a kinship exists between the inhabitants of Magnesia and Kefalonia on the basis of the kinship between Magnes and Kephalos, the son of Deion.’ (I. Magn. 35 14-16.) These two were the founders of the cities and respectively the son and grandson of Aeolos, the god of the winds. The fact that this link between the two cities, based on a mythological figure such as Aeolos, is explicitly mentioned in the decree of Same, makes it very clear that both cities fully accepted this connection. The inhabitants of Same thus saw no merit in recognizing the involiability of Magnesia and participate in the festival. After all, they were related by their common ancestor and so this was only a logical consequence. The choice for Aeolos might seem a little obscure, for there were better and more famous figures available, yet his lesser known status made it easier for the Greek poleis such as Magnesia and Same to create their own unique and local identity in a political landscape. This was a political landscape in which the individual Greek city had to increasingly give way to larger players such as Rome, the Hellenistic kingdoms and federal states. In order to build and highlight their local identity and to highlight it, these these cities eagerly used all the means of all the resources at their disposal. The example of Magnesia on the Meander makes it very clear to us that mythological kinship – no matter how far this connection had to sometimes be sought – was an intrinsic instrument to achieve this goal. An instrument which, by the way had always been used as a valid argument, regardless by whom, where or when. But more about that next time. Further reading: Erksine, A. ‘O Brother Where are thou?

This time Guest blogger Nicolaas verhelst introduces us to the founder of the Seleucid dynasty, Seleucos I Nicator. Read on to learn more about the man, the myth and the legend as well the earliest and most complex part of the Hellenistic Age: the Successor Wars. The story of the Seleukids started somewhere in Makedonia, around the year 358 BCE, when a child was born to Antiochos and Laodike. Their son, Seleukos, grew up as a member of the aristocracy, learning the art of war, but also of music, theatre, writing, and dance, together with the other sons of noble descent and even the slightly younger Alexander himself. Seleukos’ role in the great campaigns of this Macedonian king was rather limited in comparison to Alexander’s other noble companions. Nonetheless he would rise to the position of commander of the Silvershields, an elite (though not very loyal) unit of the Makedonian phalanx, even marrying Apame, daughter of the Sogdian ruler Spitamenes, at the great marriage of Susa – and, unlike most of those married at Susa, keeping her by his side till her death. The Great King’s death, however, was as sudden and unexpected as his rise to power. After Alexander III breathed his last breath in Babylon on the 11th of June 323 BCE, the empire was left to his mentally handicapped brother Philippos III Arrhidaios and his posthumous son by Roxane, Alexander IV. Real power lay therefore in the hands of Perdikkas, a former general, now regent of the empire. A shrewd man surrounded by potential rivals, he decided to start his rule by dividing up the different satrapies as if slices of a great cake between many of Alexander’s former commanders, afterwards named the Diadochoi. Even though Seleukos did not get a piece at the start, Perdikkas’ rise to power came with great benefits to him, since he was appointed leader of the feared Companion Cavalry and under-commander of the Makedonian forces, being second only to Perdikkas himself. This good fortune did not last long however, for the ambitions of the Diadochoi brought them into conflict with one another. Perdikkas was quite quickly murdered by a number of his own officers, possibly – though unlikely – Seleukos was among them. His most powerful rivals and murderers gathered at Tripadeisos where they divided the imperial cake and marshalled their armies to fight those satraps still loyal to Perdikkas’ legacy. Antipater, an older general from Philippos’ time, became the new strongman and, important for this narrative, was shortly thereafter saved by Seleukos and Antigonos, another former commander and satrap of most of Asia Minor, from mutinous soldiers. For his participation and loyalty Seleukos was rewarded with the satrapy of Babylonia, rich in agricultural resources, cities, and temples, but poor in troops. Though practically still under the control of another man, Seleukos conquered it quickly. Thus, our future king came into the possession which would for a long time be the center of his power. Yet once again fate proved to be a fickle mistress, as Antipater died after only two short years. A civil war broke out between his chosen successor, the older commander Polyperchon, and his son Cassander, further dividing Alexander’s already fracturing empire. Whilst this conflict was ravaging Macedon, to the east the vast army of Eumenes of Cardia, a Perdikkas-loyalist and the satrap of Cappadocia, marched towards Babylon and Seleukos. Realising that his own troops were insufficient to stop such a force, Seleukos decided to submit to Antigonos who had followed Eumenes with an army of his own, thus saving his own skin. Unfortunately for him though his relationship with Antigonos rapidly soured, forcing him to flee Babylonia and seek refuge at the court of Egypt’s satrap, Ptolemy. Now that Antigonos had become the most powerful of the Diadochoi, the others turned against him. Cassander who had defeated his rival; Lysimachos who had managed to safely and rather quietly hold on to his satrapy of Thrace all this time; and Ptolemy joined together to destroy this new threat, whilst Seleukos was made the commander of Ptolemy’s fleet, an office which he successfully completed. Antigonos could not let this challenge pass him by and sent his son Demetrios with an army to vanquish Ptolemy, but his plan failed as Demetrios was defeated at Gaza, where with many others the newly appointed satrap of Babylonia fell. Using this opportunity and with the blessing and assistance of Ptolemy, Seleukos raised a small army and quickly reconquered his territory.. This time however, Seleukos would not allow himself to be used by others. After defeating an eastern force led by some of Antigonos’ allies, he managed to conquer most of the eastern satrapies with surprising speed, even if Demetrios threatened and possibly even briefly conquered Babylon. Seleukos returned in triumph, only to find himself faced with a reinvigorated Antigonos who had managed to make peace with the other diadochi and could now devote his full attentions to Babylonia. Having received new troops and provisions from his conquered territories, Seleukos nonetheless had a much better chance than before. He finally – even with the possibility of losing Babylon again – managed to drive the invader back, helped by the start of a new war between Ptolemy and Antigonos. Thanks to an uneasy peace with Antigonos, Seleukos was able to fortify his borders with new cities and he could turn his attention to ruling. He founded his new capital Seleukia-on-the-Tigris at the northern tip of Babylonia where the courses of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers lie closer together. New conflicts still loomed on the horizon. By this time both Philippos III and Alexander IV had been murdered, so Antigonos declared himself king in 306 BCE, quickly followed by the rest of the surviving Diadochoi. Their new claims of kingship were of course direct challenges of the other’s power. Before dealing with Antigonos, Seleukos was forced to turn east one last time to face the threat of the Mauryan king Chandragupta who wanted to conquer the most eastern satrapies, and eventually making a peace treaty with him exchanging his claims on the satrapies of the Indian subcontinent and the Hindu Kush for 500 elephants, an alliance through the marriage of Chandragupta with Seleukos’ daughter Berenike. Map of the Diadochoi-kingdoms around 303 BCE With peace restored at his eastern borders Seleukos turned west again and, together with Cassander and Lysimachos, defeated Antigonos in the battle of Ipsos resulting in the death of the latter. Though Seleukos had been formally granted the whole of Syria after the victory, Ptolemy quickly captured the territories from the Sinaï to Phoenica, leading to tense, but still peaceful, relations between the two kings. Now that Antigonos was dead and Demetrios defeated and because of the direct threat posed by Ptolemy and Lysimachos who had managed to capture Asia Minor, Seleukos married Demetrios’ daughter Stratonike after the death of his wife Apame. Though he would later divorce Stratonike and marry her off to his eldest son, successor, and – from 292 BCE on – co-ruler Antiochos I. Of course, their alliance did not last long and Seleukos attacked Demetrios, who by this time had invaded Macedonia and defeated Cassander, having successfully convinced many of his (at that time still) unpaid troops to switch sides and even imprisoning his opponent, though Demetrios’ son Antigonos (another great example of the uninventiveness of Macedonian naming practices) still held Macedonia. At this point Seleukos seemed to be becoming the most powerful Diadoch, therefore Lysimachos and Ptolemy started mistrusting him. After Lysimachos executed his own son on the charges of treachery – resulting in a widespread revolt – Seleukos invaded Asia Minor and defeated and killed Lysimachos at the battle of Kourupedion in 281 BCE. Since Ptolemy died from old age in 283 BCE, Seleukos was now the last surviving Diadoch and his conquest of all of Alexander’s former empire, except for Egypt and the satrapies he had given up in the east, seemed a given: Asia Minor was mostly his, Thrace was leaderless after the death of Lysimachos, and Macedonia was so ravaged by civil war that all he had to do was effectively march into Pella with his army. Seleukos was at the height of his power and though by this time an old man of around 77, his dominion seemed secure. It was, however, not meant to be. For almost in the fashion of a Greek tragedy in which the gods punish men for their hybris, he was murdered by Ptolemy Ceraunus, the exiled half-brother of Ptolemy II who had taken refuge at his court. This new political player took control of his armies and conquered Macedonia (although he would not hold it for long). No other Diadoch or Seleukid king, not even Antiochos III ‘the Great’, would come as close to unifying Alexander’s empire as Seleukos, and his son Antiochos I would face many great enemies before some semblance of peace would return to the empire. The Seleukid Empire was not only forged in steel and blood however, for in his conquests Seleukos had had to negotiate with many local leaders and elites. His descendants would continue this process, though not always with success, helping to bring the many cultures of their empire closer together and forging traditions which would last for hundreds of years after its fall. The history of the Seleukid Empire is thus not a part of Western or for that matter Eastern history – both terms denying the connectivity of the world both in ancient and modern times – nor an example of a clash of civilisations. It is rather a prime example of how cultural exchange took place during antiquity and of the beauty that is the tapestry of human civilisation. Though I do not possess the gifts or allure of one such as Irving Finkel (I’m fairly certain it’s the beard, also the practically unequalled knowledge of cuneiform, but mainly the beard), I hope to have at least somewhat inspired you to read and learn more about this most wonderful of periods, and this most intriguing of empires. Though for now my studies mainly focus on child of the gods (θεόπαις) Babylon, I hope one day we will meet in minds if not in person within the borders of the Seleukid Empire. Further reading: D.

Read on to learn more about the man, the myth and the legend as well the earliest and most complex part of the Hellenistic Age: the Successor Wars. The story of the Seleukids started somewhere in Makedonia, around the year 358 BCE, when a child was born to Antiochos and Laodike. Their son, Seleukos, grew up as a member of the aristocracy, learning the art of war, but also of music, theatre, writing, and dance, together with the other sons of noble descent and even the slightly younger Alexander himself.

Nonetheless he would rise to the position of commander of the Silvershields, an elite (though not very loyal) unit of the Makedonian phalanx, even marrying Apame, daughter of the Sogdian ruler Spitamenes, at the great marriage of Susa – and, unlike most of those married at Susa, keeping her by his side till her death. The Great King’s death, however, was as sudden and unexpected as his rise to power. After Alexander III breathed his last breath in Babylon on the 11th of June 323 BCE, the empire was left to his mentally handicapped brother Philippos III Arrhidaios and his posthumous son by Roxane, Alexander IV.

A shrewd man surrounded by potential rivals, he decided to start his rule by dividing up the different satrapies as if slices of a great cake between many of Alexander’s former commanders, afterwards named the Diadochoi. Even though Seleukos did not get a piece at the start, Perdikkas’ rise to power came with great benefits to him, since he was appointed leader of the feared Companion Cavalry and under-commander of the Makedonian forces, being second only to Perdikkas himself. This good fortune did not last long however, for the ambitions of the Diadochoi brought them into conflict with one another. Perdikkas was quite quickly murdered by a number of his own officers, possibly – though unlikely – Seleukos was among them.

Antipater, an older general from Philippos’ time, became the new strongman and, important for this narrative, was shortly thereafter saved by Seleukos and Antigonos, another former commander and satrap of most of Asia Minor, from mutinous soldiers. For his participation and loyalty Seleukos was rewarded with the satrapy of Babylonia, rich in agricultural resources, cities, and temples, but poor in troops. Though practically still under the control of another man, Seleukos conquered it quickly. Thus, our future king came into the possession which would for a long time be the center of his power. Yet once again fate proved to be a fickle mistress, as Antipater died after only two short years.

Whilst this conflict was ravaging Macedon, to the east the vast army of Eumenes of Cardia, a Perdikkas-loyalist and the satrap of Cappadocia, marched towards Babylon and Seleukos. Realising that his own troops were insufficient to stop such a force, Seleukos decided to submit to Antigonos who had followed Eumenes with an army of his own, thus saving his own skin. Unfortunately for him though his relationship with Antigonos rapidly soured, forcing him to flee Babylonia and seek refuge at the court of Egypt’s satrap, Ptolemy. Now that Antigonos had become the most powerful of the Diadochoi, the others turned against him.

Antigonos could not let this challenge pass him by and sent his son Demetrios with an army to vanquish Ptolemy, but his plan failed as Demetrios was defeated at Gaza, where with many others the newly appointed satrap of Babylonia fell. Using this opportunity and with the blessing and assistance of Ptolemy, Seleukos raised a small army and quickly reconquered his territory.

What does one generally know about them? Not nearly enough. In this two part series Guest author Nicolaas Verhelst introduces us to the history of the Seleucid dynasty. In this first part he starts with an ode to the Seleucid kings and their vast and complex empire. He explains some of the reasons why some of us may not know as much as we would like to about one of the three Hellenistic kingdoms and makes a compelling case as to why we should find out more! Imagine if you will the Hellenistic world and all that you know about it: Alexander the Great Conqueror, Athens in its political heyday, its glory not yet lost or forgotten, proud and independent Epirus before Pyrrhos’ unlucky campaigns, Makedon always trying but never succeeding to recapture the glory of the Argeads, and of course Egypt, home of the Ptolemies and marvel of its time where the Makedonian conqueror witnessed the ancient civilisation of the Pharaohs and the wonder of Alexandria was born. Ah, Alexandria with its schools and libraries, its port and Pharos, city of scholars and kings. Now forget all that and turn your gaze to the East, to an empire, less famous and more mysterious. The Diadochoi Kingdoms ca. 270 BCE Look to Pergamon and its powerful Attalid rulers on the coasts of Asia Minor. See Galatia, land of Gallic tribes who journeyed thousands of miles and fought countless battles to settle in this land of opportunity, bordered by fortified cities, stalwart protectors against the Galatian threat. Discover Phoenicia, land of navigators and explorers who once mapped all the known seas, mother to the mighty empire of Carthage, its kings now reduced or gone, its cities prostrating themselves before a new dynasty. Discover Syria and Cilicia and their new and re-founded cities, guardians of the inland and the roads between Asia Minor and the imperial capitals. Leave the Mediterranean and travel to the ancient land of Sumer and Akkad, to Babylonia where Greek astronomers admitted their ignorance and men who had not blinked at the sight of the amassed Persian armies gazed in wonder at sky-reaching temples, the living core of a great kingdom. Behold still further, the satrapies of Media and Persia where once the great-grandson of Teispes had dreamt of Empire, and Bactria where Zoroastrianism, Hellenic religion, and local beliefs intermixed and flourished, their cities and peoples constantly under threat by horsemen from the northern plains. Turn your eyes finally to the edges of the Hellenistic world, to Alexandria Eschata, Alexandria Ultima, where the Han-empire was fought in the War of the Heavenly Horses, and to India where Aśoka the Great reigned over most of the subcontinent, including some former satrapies of Alexander’s empire. Where he wrote down his laws in Prakrit, Aramaic, and Greek, and where later Greco-Indian kings would convert to Buddhism and influence its art and philosophy, their kingdoms surviving decades past the fall of the last Ptolemies. All these regions, all their populations, cultures, languages, and religions were once ruled or at the very least claimed by the descendants of divine Apollo, the Seleukids, mighty kings before the decline of their empire. Greek writing on a clay-tablet (presumably a school-exercise, HSM) Their coins, their sculptures, their inscriptions and clay tablets, their institutions, their renewed languages, their mixed religions, and their stories would long survive the fall of the Seleukid kingdom and inspire countless others in their dreams of rule and domination. Their glory and their importance lay, at least to my mind however, far more in their openness to meetings and exchanges of cultures, languages, and religions. Exchanges in which a man of Indian descent could write a funerary inscription in Homeric Greek worthy of the scholars of Alexandria, a king of Commagene could claim descendance both of Persian king Dareios I as well as Hellenistic kings Seleukos I and Ptolemaios I or a person could travel from the Bosporos to the edge of the Fergana Valley, only ever needing mastery of ancient Greek. The Sophytosinscription from Kandahar (a personal favourite) and a wall-relief depicting Antiochos of Commagene and Herakles To our great misfortune, most of the history of this once great empire remains hidden to us, both due to the vastness of its territories and languages, and due to the lack and the complexity of the source material, with only the regions of Asia Minor and Babylonia offering large quantities of textual sources: either Greek inscriptions or cuneiform tablets. Yet this deficiency is also due to the woes of modern scholarship and public interest. Racism long held sway both in the public opinion and the academic world, having yet to fully disappear from either (having often been rebranded and become cultural racism). Thus, the Hellenistic kingdoms were often presented as unworthy successors of Alexander’s empire, in territory, but mainly in culture, never equaling the “purity” of the ancient Greek world, which was considered to have degraded thanks to the wiles of the East. Even if this view has long been discarded to the scrapheap of history – still receiving the occasional angry kick from historians, archaeologists, linguists, and many more besides – its effects on our view of Ancient History have been profound. Still the glory of Ancient Athens and Sparta, and of the empire of the senate and the people of Rome are lauded in classrooms across the world, whilst the Hellenistic kingdoms are mostly ignored or forgotten, even if they do receive some attention in strategy games. Egypt has somewhat escaped this curse due to its meteoric rise in popularity in the past century and so the Ptolemies have been somewhat luckier than their counterparts in this regard. Although Cleopatra VII is often still depicted as an oriental beauty and temptress instead of a, if not beautiful, strikingly intelligent person who used her mind and body for the sake of her kingdom, her children, and her people. But I for one feel proud to make a case, besides many others, for the Seleukids, not least of all because they actually varied their royal names between Seleukos and Antiochos, which makes them twice as good as the Ptolemies in my book.

After its discovery in 1820 on the greek island of milos, it has captured the imagination of the many people who look upon it every year. The statue itself is a prime example of Hellenistic sculpture as it shows the drama in its composition and attention to detail that is typical for the period. It has long been thought that this woman is none other than Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. But is this really the case and if she is not Aphrodite, then who is she? Elke Close Finding Aphrodite? The statue was discovered in 1820 on the Greek island of Milos. The exact conditions of this discovery are conflicting and misleading but the general idea is this: a Greek farmer and his father or son found the statue while plowing his field or searching for reusable building blocks on or near the farmer’s plot of land which was on a rocky hillside. There they either saw the statue in a small cavity, found it hidden away in a niche or found it among the ancient city ruins. The different versions also mention that together with the statue several herms and other marble fragments were found such an upper arm and a hand holding an object and that it the statue was found with the two marble blocks still joined together. Whatever the real story was, remains a mystery. After the discovery, the statue was presented by the Marquis de Rivière, the French ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the time, to king Louis XVIII who in turn donated it to the Louvre. Describing Aphrodite? The statue was made out of two different marble slabs on which additional parts were connected through the use of vertical pegs. These parts – such as the, left leg, bust, left arm and foot – were sculpted separately. Unlike the clean marble look we are used to seeing today, the statue wore jewelry like bracelet, earrings, and headband made from metal. Parts of her could have been coloured in with paint. However none of these decorative elements are remain visible today aside from the fixation holes for the metal jewelry. The arms of the statue were never found. Dating Aphrodite? Originally, Praxiteles or Scopas were named as the creators of the statue, but a plinth found with the statue bore the following inscription: ‘[Alex]ander, son of [M]enides, from [Ant]iochia on the Menander, made this [statue]‘. The mention of the of Antioch on the Menander dates this work to the Hellenistic period. Even so, the statue has often been thought to be a copy of an original from the fourth century as it shows many similarities to the Aphrodite of Capua. While she does have characteristics of classical Greek sculpture such as her impassive gaze, idealized features and hairstyle, certain Hellenistic innovations cannot be ignored. The composition of her body with a slight twist, the elongated torso and the placement of the figure in a three-dimensional space as well as the attention to the drapery of her clothing all point to the Hellenistic period. Designating Aphrodite? Statue of the goddess Amphitrite, from Milos together with the statue of Poseidon, form the first century BC. Archaeological Museum Athens Marble statue of Poseidon made around 125-100 BC, found on Milos together with the statue of Amphitrite in the Archaeological Museum of Athens. The statue is thought to represent the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite. This identification was immediately made based on the woman’s naked torso as well as the round object found in the hand that was found with statue. This round object was supposedly seen as the apple of discord. There is no certainty however that this hand – and the apple – actually belonged to the statue, even though there are several known examples of a Venus statue holding an apple. The lack of arms and attributes makes a certain identification and possible recreation very difficult. Several of these reconstructions exist: Aphrodite together with Mars, holding a stylus, mirror, apple, leaning on a column, etc.. She has been interpreted as Nike, Artemis, or even a mere mortal. Some scholars have also argued that this is actually the sea goddess Amphitrite, the wife of Poseidon. She was widely popular on the island of Milos and was worshipped there as is indicated by another statue of the sea goddess and her husband which was also found on the island. The three statues were made around the same time, but our ‘Venus’ is very different from the statue of Amphitrite seen above. Is this difference solely the result of the artists’ interpretation of the same goddess or was there a different way of depicting Amphitrite which makes the identification of the ‘Venus de Milo’ as the sea goddess a bit more difficult? Whether or not this was actually Aphrodite or Amphitrite or Artemis or Nike, it will remain impossible to say, unless her arms magically appear. For now, this lady is keeping her real identity a secret. Further reading: Astier, M.B. Aphrodite, known as the “Venus de Milo”. Curtis, G. Disarmed: The Story of the Venus de Milo, 2004.

One of the most famous horses of the ancient world. Despite his famed beauty and nobility, he had a rather common name, since boukephalous in greek means ‘ox-headed’. According to tradition, there were several explanations for his name, the most interesting of which was that the horse had actual horns. coincidentally , several coins were minted in antiquity with a horned horse on them. Is there a link between the two? by Michelle Simon Silver Coin of Seleucus I Nicator, Pergamum, 281 BC. The obverse shows a horned, bridled horse head right and the reverse shows an elephant walking right with the inscription BAΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΣΕΛΕΥΚΟΥ. (c) Seleucid Coins Online In the 1990s two renowned numismatic experts described coins of the type shown above as Bukephalos. Their identification is based on the presence of these “famous” horns. Portraying the noble steed on such a small scale as a silver coin must have been challenging and thus a play on the name Bukephalos by adding horns to the horse depicted on the tetradrachms was one solution. To assume they depict Bukephalos would suggest two things. First that the legend of the horned Bukephalos must have been around during and shortly after the reign of Alexander for people to even understand this symbolism. Secondly, that awareness of this legend must have been widespread. As we learned from a previous article, coins were an important part of creating and representing identity – and Bukephalos seems to be an odd choice for this purpose. Whoever minted these coins did so with a plan in mind: a political agenda, a commemoration of an important event or some kind of connection towards this horse. In fact, the authority behind these coins was none other than Seleukos I, a Makedonian general under Alexander III. He later became the founder of both the Seleukid Empire and the Seleukid Dynasty. The connection between Alexander III and Seleukos I could explain his knowledge of the horse (and maybe a certain fondness towards it), but not the reason for it being used in his coinage. Seleukos I was a powerful figure in his own merit: being at war with the other Diadochi and forging his own empire. Given the importance of coinage as a form of representation, why would he lean this heavily on Alexander’s horse instead of the king himself? The coins themselves are confidently engraved with BAΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΣΕΛΕΥΚΟΥ – Seleukos, the King, and nothing more. Silver Coin of Seleucus I Nicator, Susa, 301 BC – 295 BC showing the head of a hero right (assimilating Seleucus, Alexander, and Dionysus), wearing helmet covered with panther skin and adorned with bull’s ear and horns on the obverse. The reverse shows the inscription BAΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΣΕΛΕΥΚΟΥ and Nike standing right, crowning trophy. (c) Seleucid Coins Online The answer might be found when considering his other coins, which show the basileus himself (as some suggest) or a hero formed by merging Seleukos I, Alexander III, and the god Dionysos, adorned with the horns of a bull, sometimes even with additional bull’s ears. They are different from the curled ram’s horns given to those portraying themselves (or being portrayed by their descendants) as favourites of the mighty god Zeus-Ammon, but they do bear a similar message: I am a mighty ruler, blessed by the gods and gifted with extraordinary power. This is a message Seleukos I’s new subjects would easily understand, because he was drawing on symbolism which had been in use within ancient Near East art and iconography for centuries. As we said before, coins were an important tool for both the spreading of propaganda and the creation of identity. Seleukos I, as a foreign ruler, carefully used the horns as something most of his local now-subjects would recognize as a sign of royalty and even divine blessing. Coins may be the first and only “direct” message these people ever received from their new ruler. Combining local symbolism with the Greek inscription and Hellenistic-style portrait might have been a successful attempt at reaching as many of his subjects as possible, while creating a strong image for any outsider. Seleukos I required legitimacy for his new position as ruler as he was not the descendant of a long-ruling dynasty but rather an outsider to many of his Middle Eastern subjects, constantly threatened by the fierce competition and fighting between the Diadochai. As part of this iconography, the horns are paired with other well-known and mighty animals, such as war elephants and horses. The war elephant being an animal used by the Persians (and later by Alexander III), the horse an old and well-known symbol for both royalty and military prowess for any Makedon, used heavily by Philipp II, the father of Alexander III. The use of these images seems to have done its job as Seleukos I’s son Antiochos I employed it again, showing his own portrait on the obvers, with the steer-horned horse on the reverse, now additionally bearing an almost flame-like mane. Silver Coin of Antiochus I Soter, Ai Khanoum/Bactra, 280 BC. The obverse shows the diademed head of Antiochus I right while the reverse has the inscription BAΣΙΛΕΩΣ ANTIOXOY together with a horned and bridled horse head right. (c) Seleucid Coins Online So, what can we learn from this? The discourse about these coins has not come to a definite end, but there is a high probability that they were never intended to reference the myth of the horned Bukephalos. Furthermore, it does not seem likely that the myth of the horned Bukephalos even existed at this time due to the absence of any contemporary reference to the myth, and it seems equally unlikely that these coins supported the propagation of this myth later on because the coins themselves were not far spread and our ancient and medieval sources most likely did not know of their existence. It was only after they were “re-discovered” by the orientalist scholars of the 19th and 20th century that the link between the coins and the myth was created, misreading Seleukos I’s usage of local religious symbolism as a way of forging a connection to Alexander III through his famous steed. Scholarly tradition then carried this theory well into our present day, where even the Wikipedia article about Seleukos I still features a coin “depicting Alexander’s horse Bukephalos”. It is a wonderful example of how the interpretation of such coins can change over the decades and one thing is for sure – the horned horse has not given up all its mysteries. Michelle Simon studies Ancient History in Marburg (Germany). When she isn’t following the traces of the representation of Makedonian rulers (and their horses) on coins and in writing, she spends much of her time playing D&D, teaching archery or in the pursuit of stuffing even more books into her already overflowing bookshelves.","tokens":1618,"chunks":[{"article_title":"Numismatics and the legend of horned Bukephalos","article_url":"https://www.hellenistichistory.com/2021/02/25/numismatics-and-the-legend-of-horned-bukephalos/","article_date":"2021-02-25T18:34:06+00:00","content":"In her last post, Michelle simon introduced us to Alexander’s horse bukephalos.

It was only after they were “re-discovered” by the orientalist scholars of the 19th and 20th century that the link between the coins and the myth was created, misreading Seleukos I’s usage of local religious symbolism as a way of forging a connection to Alexander III through his famous steed.

After all, as I pointed out in the previous entry, to us it might seem strange that the citizens of Greek poleis unequivocally believed that Pasiphae, the wife of King Minos, had given birth to a being that was half man and half bull. Or that the hero Achilles was invulnerable – except for his heel, of course – because his mother Thetis had submerged him in the Styx to prevent him from dying at a young age. Yet Greek historiography and literature often refer to King Minos and Achilles in their narratives. Was the distinction between myth and history then so blurred to the Greeks? And more importantly, did the Greeks really believe in these – surely implausible – stories? In general, the Greeks believed that the earliest stories about their heroes as we can find them in Hesiod or Homer were tantamount to their early history. After all, they believed that these figures were men who had effectively lived in the regions in which their descendants still roamed generations later. The idea of continuity between these mythological times and events so-called ‘historical’ events is a general tendency which can be found in both the literary and epigraphic sources. For example, the following excerpt can be read in the Parian Marble, a stele from Paros in which a chronological overview of Greek history is given: ‘From when there was a [shortage] of crops in Athens and, when [Apo]llo answered to the Athen[ers] who consulted the oracle that any [fine] should promise to Minos whom he considered just, 1031 years , when Aegeus was king of Athens.’ (r. 33-35) For the author of this stele, which was made after 264 BC, the story of Minos was as much a part of the history of Greece as Alexander’s battle at Issus in 333 BC or the Lamian War in which the Athenians took on Antipater in 323-322 BC. The idea that myth was part of the earliest history of Greece can also be noted among Greek historians such as Herodotos or Thycidides. The first does not question the existence of Kekrops, the legendary half-serpent king of Athens (Hist. 8.44), while the latter mentions how surprising is is that it took the Greeks ten years to defeat the Trojans (1.11.). So do I believe that Herodotus, as the father of history, really believed in the existence of snake people? Of course not. Indeed, after Herodotus gives an overview of various mythological events that contributed to the antagonism between east and west, he says the following: ‘Whether this last account is true, or whether the matter happened differently, I shall not discuss further. I shall proceed at once to point out the person who first, as far as I know, harmed the Greeks, after which I shall proceed with my history.’ (Hist. 1.5.3.) And even though Herodotos believed in the existence of Helen of Troy, he probably did not think that she was the daughter of Zeus and Leda. Apparently, he did not even believe that she spent the ten years of the Trojan War in Troy as he provides us with an alternative version of the story in which Paris and Helena had spent ten years in Egypt with the local priests (Hist. 2.113-120). Diodoros also uses these stories in his history because he recognizes the importance of these stories for writing contemporary history. He also points out an additional difficulty these historians were faced with: the starting point of their story is so far away that they had to rely on these myths to a large extent. They could not, therefore, simply throw these stories away: if they did do so, very little of the Greek history before 800 BC remained. To solve this problem, the focus was placed on the less fantastic elements of these legendary stories and, as a result, some sort of truth could still be extracted from these stories. For even those who reject the stories of the Trojan War as written by Homer as complete fiction, cannot deny that archaeological finds at the site of Troy indicate that fighting took place there in the 12th century BC. This does not mean, of course, that we should be careful when seeking the “historical core” or an absolute truth in mythological stories. Is it possible, then, to answer the question I posed at the beginning of this essay: did the Greek believe their own myths? Paul Veyne clearly thought so. After all, he stated that: “But of course they believed in their myths” and “They believe in them, but they use them and cease believing at the point where their interest in believing ends”! (1) So, according to Veyne, most Greeks believed their own myths, but only up to the point when it was no longer convenient to be convinced by these stories. Of course, there will have been Greeks who believed these stories literally, but for writers like Herodotos or Greek political leaders, these stories were the tools of choice to realize their some of their own goals: whether this was the writing of an account of all the deeds done by Greeks and Barbarians, or the funding of the construction of a city wall which had been destroyed by an earthquake as was the case in Kytinion in 205 BC.

This is no surprise as his military conquests and travels shaped the Hellenistic era in a way which no other individual has done. Yet far fewer people know the name of one of his most trusty companions, his horse Bukephalus. In a series of posts, guest writer Michelle Simon is going to tell us a little more about Alexander’s trusty horse. In this first part we start with his name. Why was he even called Bukephalos? Bukephalos, the famous steed of Alexander the Great, is by far one of the most renowned horses of classical antiquity. Praised for his strength and beauty, he supposedly rescued his renowned rider more than once from harm on the numerous battlefields they entered. Curiously, his name, meaning ox-headed (βουκέφαλος), is far from glamorous. Contemporary sources about the Macedonian ruler are far less abundant than the extent of his legend might make you believe. None of them offer an answer as to why such a noble (and expensive) stallion would bear such an uninspiring name. Arrian, writing in the middle of the second century BC (almost 200 years after the original events!) has two explanations for its name. First, it could stem from the brand the horse bore: an ox-head marked him as a famous breed from ancient Thracia. Or it could have been the white marking on the otherwise black animal which reminded people of a horned bovine (Arr. Anab. 5,19,5). The first theory seems to be more likely, as several other findings in unrelated sources mention the ox-head brand as a sign for horses of good quality. It would still make for a rather uninspired name, but after all we are talking about someone who named more than fifteen cities after himself. Bukephalos in Chains But the stories did not stop there and soon another explanation made its way into the books: Bukephalos got his name from having actual horns. The Byzantine encyclopaedia Etymologicum Magnum (written roughly 1400 years after Alexander) has explained that Alexander put gilded horns on his horse as a kind of adornment. Other sources speculate even further. The famous Alexander Romance, more a literary genre than a single work, happily informed the reader that the horse was called Bukephalus either because of his breed or the horn quite literally protruding from his head.

In this post we will be exploring some of the typical characteristics of Hellenistic sculpture via some of its most famous statues. Alexander’s conquests and the creation of the Hellenistic kingdoms created a cosmopolitan environment which influenced the art as well. It no longer depicted just the gods or idealized subjects. Instead art was made for a variety of reasons, appealing to an increasingly diverse audience. A new style of statues moved away from idealized beauty and instead focused on extreme realistic depictions of the every day person and extreme emotions, experimenting even with issues such as disability, gender, drunkenness or old age. Portraits became more and more popular and naturalistic and statues were also found in theatrical and grandiose compositions such as the Altar of Pergamon. The creation of statue groups with dramatic compositions was another Hellenistic innovation, probably dated the third century. The epic battles of earlier temple pediment reliefs had been off their walls, and placed them in life‑size groups of statues. The winged Nike of Samothrace It was discovered in 1863 on the island of Samothrace by Charles Champoiseau, the French Vice‑Consul of Turkey. The winged goddess of victory was seen on top of the prow of a ship with strong winds blowing through her clothes. The work had been placed into a niche inside a hill overlooking the theatre of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. This sanctuary was dedicated to the Cabeiri, gods who were supposed to protect sailors and seafarers and gain victory in war. The creation of the statue of Nike was most likely commissioned to commemorate a naval battle. The type of ship and the base of the statue indicate that it was created by the Rhodians and perhaps suggesting a battle during the second century BC. The winged Nike of Samothrace shows the Hellenistic tendency for drama and extreme composition very well as we can see from the angles of the wings, the placement of the leg and flowing of the clothing. The realism of Hellenistic art is evidenced by the wet clothing hanging from the goddess’ naked body. The drama, intense composition and movement as well as the realistic depiction of the goddess clearly explain why this is such a favourite statue among the visitors of the Louvre. The hanging of Marsyas The hanging of Marsyas was a Hellenistic sculpture group created at Pergamon in the third century BC. Depicted in the post are three Roman copies, one from the Louvre in Paris,a second from the Capitoline Museum in Rome and the last one in several pieces from the Altes Museum in Berlin. Marsyas was a Silenus, an avid follower of Dionysos who boasted that he was a better musician than Apollo. After a musical contest, Apollo was declared the winner and Marsyas was punished: he was hun from a tree and skinned alive by a Scythian slave. The Berlin torso was part of a statue group, probably including Apollo and the Scythian. The Hellenistic sculpture shows a remarkable eye for detail: the pain on his face, his tortured body. This once again displays the tendency to focus on realism, older subjects and dramatic composition. Statue of dying Gaul This is statue of a dying Gaul is made from Parian marble. It was found on the agora of the Italians on the island of Delos. The warrior who has fallen to the ground on his right knee, he has a wound in his thigh. He was attempting to defend himself against his enemy with his left hand. On the ground next to him, you can see a Galatian helmet. It is a typical example of Late Hellenistic Art with the influences of the Pergamene school, which was marked by a high degree of emotion and a pronounced naturalism, creating a sense of reality in the spectator. The sculpture was probably made by the sculptor Agasias around 100 BC. Laocoon and his sons The famous Roman copy of a Hellenistic original is dated to the first century BC but is in the traditional style of “Pergamene baroque” which became popular in Greek Asia Minor around 200 BC. The best known example of this style is the Pergamene Altar. Venus of Milo One of the most famous Greek statues in modern times and was discovered in 1820 on the island of Milos, buried within a hidden niche inside the ancient city. The statue itself was found in two pieces together with several herms. The arms were never found. The marble sculpture was created by Alexander of Antioch between 130 and 100 BC and is 203 cm tall. It is thought to represent the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite. Although some scholars have also argued that she is actually a sea goddess called Amphitrite, who was widely popular on the island of Milos. The identification of the goddess is made very difficult by the lack of arms and attributes. The statue has often been thought to be a replica of an original of the fourth century because of the similarities to the Aphrodite of Capua. While she does have classical characteristics such as impassivity, idealised features and hairstyle, there are certain innovations that make this a typical Hellenistic statue: such as the spinal composition, the elongated body and the placing of the figure in the three‑dimensional space. Crouching Venus This statue shows a crouching Venus or Aphrodite. The Roman copy of a Hellenistic original dates back to the second century AD ‑ the original was made around 200 BC ‑ shows the goddess crouched down with her hair loosely bundled on her head and hanging on her shoulder. While it looks like a Classical Greek statue, the dynamic swing of her hips puts this statue into the Hellenistic period. Torso of a fisherman This torso of a old fisherman is the embodiment of Hellenistic art, even though it is another Roman copy of a Hellenistic original. The tendency of Hellenistic sculptors to pursue and perfect naturalism led to an increasing depiction of the everyday Greek such as fishermen, shepherds or beggars. This fisherman is depicted with an unparalleled sense of the frailty the comes with old age and the sculptor clearly moving away from the idealism typical of the Classical period. Clear attention has been paid to the anatomy of the old fisherman making it an extremely interesting portrait of an ‘ordinary’ subject. The head is a plaster copy of the original head which was found later than the torso (found in 1905) near the baths of Aphrosidias in 1989 in Turkey.⠀ Aphrodite and Pan This Hellenistic marble statue group of Pan, Aphrodite and Eros dates around 100 BC and was found on Delos. The goddess appears to be holding a shoe in her hand which is quite unusual. Aphrodite is covering het genitals while Pan is attempting to force her hand away. Eros, the God of love is flying in between them and is pulling Pan by the horns away from Aphrodite. Knuckle playing girl The girl playing astragalus or the knuckle bone game comes from the Eastern slope of the Caelian hill. Made from marble, the body is dated around 150 AD, while the head was constructed around 200 AD. While the theme of a seated young girl is a typical example of the late Hellenistic tendency to realism, the addition of the girl playing astragalus is a Roman supplementation. The fact that this scene was featured often in funerary settings and on grave staled, points to a sepulchral purpose of the statue. Jockey of Artemision The so‑called jockey of Artemision, displayed at the archaeological museum in Athens, is a rare example of Hellenistic bronze statue that survived the passing of time. Made around 150 BC, this cast of a race horse ‑ which is already an unusual choice of subject in Hellenistic sculpture ‑ was found in an ancient ship wreck in the bay of Artimision by two fishermen at the start of the 20th century. Some parts of the horse have been restored. On it you can see an image of Nike holding a wreath in her raised hands, a common brand for thoroughbreds in antiquity, engraved on the animal’s right thigh. Mounted on the horse is a small boy wearing a chiton, creating clear contrast between the huge horse and the small boy. Bronze statue of Artemis This bronze statue of Artemis was found together with the bronze Athena of Piraeus in a storeroom in the harbour where it was store in 86 BC for safekeeping during Sulla’s raid of Piraeus. The statue is dated to the mid-fourth century BC and is attributed to the sculptor Euphranor because of it similarity to the Apollo Patroos on the Agora.There is an attachment on the back of the statue for Artemis’ famous quiver. Before this was discovered, the robust figure was thought to have been a muse or poetess of some kind. Athena of Piraeus This is the Piraeus Athena. It is a bronze statue of the goddess who is wearing a Doric peplos with a large overfold to cover her back and a diagonal aegis covered in tiny snakes. Two owls adorn her Corinthian helmet. In her hands she would normally hold a spear and a libation bowl. The statue has been attributed to Kephisodotos or Euphranor and was either created in the late 4th century BC or a classisizing work from the Hellenistic period. It was found in 1959 in Piraeus in a storeroom of the old harbour together with other bronze statues, having been put there for safekeeping during Sulla’s siege of Piraeus in 86 BC. Bronze statue of a young man This is a bronze statue of young man. It was found off the coast of Marathon in Attica and was made around 340‑330 BC. He was most likely an athlete and the winner of a contest as is suggested by the band on his forehead which ends in an upright leaf above his forehead. His right hand is raised up straight but the object he was holding in his hand is not preserved. Not is the object he is looking at in his left hand. This had was replaced at a later date with the palm worked into a lamp. It is a good example of Late Classical/Early Hellenistic sculpture and is associated with school of Praxiteles.

They were at the heart of Greek religion, taught valuable life lessons to young and old and provided an explanation for unusual natural phenomena. Greek mythology was thus very much a part of the Greek identity. It is therefore not surprising that this connection was used by many poleis in the expression of their regional identity. Naturally, the history of any city in the Mediterranean starts with its foundation by a legendary king or hero. But it did not stop there. In 205 B.C. the walls of the polis Kytinion had been completely destroyed. This was a small city in Doris, the region in ancient Greece that was seen as the native region of the Dorians. As they did not manage to repair the wall themselves, the inhabitants decided to ask for help. Of course, the best way get this help was to send out envoys to all of the poleis that, just like them, descended from the Dorians. Because of this kinship, the other poleis would certainly be inclined to help them. The Lykian city of Xanthos was among those that received a Kytinian envoy which demonstrated the kinship between the two cities by referring to their common ancestors. What’s more, the Xanhian were apparently indebted to Kytinion for the long-lost deeds of some mythological hero. What better way to repay this debt than by helping to build a new city wall? (See Bousquet, 1988 for more) The Kytinian appeal is a typical example of the way in which their mythological past was used by Greek poleis in political, economic, social or cultural relations. This so-called kinship claim between different cities was a regular feature of diplomatic relations between the independent Greek cities, individuals and kings during the Classical and Hellenistic periods. Ambassadors or envoys were often on their way from one Greek city to another to carry out diplomatic missions such as these. This is also evident from the various cases in the historical sources which we will be examining in the coming months. But how exactly did such a process work? First of all, the city in need of something sent out an envoy to various city-states. Of course, it had to be decided beforehand which cities were potential candidates and thorough research was done into the mythological relationships that could be called upon. Each allegation also had to be backed up by sufficient evidence. The envoys then left with decrees supporting their mission, presented the case to the city in question in their speeches and, after enjoying the necessary hospitality, moved on to the next one. The results of these missions were often recorded in inscriptions and so they form a large part of the sources for the subject of this series. The evidence used to prove mythological kinship between different parties also appears to be extremely detailed. If we return for a moment to the story of Kytinion, this becomes very clear. In one part of the epigraphic text we find the following description: The kinship claim does not end here but it gives us a clear indication of how seriously the argument of mythological affiliation must be take, at least in the case of Kytinion. After all, to us it may seem like a strange idea to support an argument with things that one knows for sure did not really happen. In antiquity, however, people seemed to have less of a problem with this. Of course, it does not mean that the ancient Greeks believed these stories and mythological characters really existed. So then why were they used in Greek diplomatic relations? Initially, diplomacy was used to persuade others. Indeed, a link of kinship was only mentioned when one party wanted to obtain something from another. The idea was that if some kind of relationship was established between the two parties, it would then be much harder to refuse requests for help. A shared past could also make approaching strangers easier, because now there already was a framework in place which this could be done: because of their common ancestry they were no longer strangers to each other. (Erskine, 110). Mythological kinship ties were in some cases also used by cities or individuals to emphasise their Greek identity or their divine character. Alexander the Great, for example, invoked the kinship myth to connect the different peoples in his great empire with himself during his military conquests. After all, it proved to be a good alternative to military conquest. (Patteron, 84). Whatever the reason may have been for an individual or group to use their mythological past, it is clear that this was done a lot in antiquity. In this series, we will take a closer look at the various ways in which this was done and look at unfamiliar and interesting cases in order to hopefully better understand why the link between myth and identity was so popular among the Greeks as a diplomatic tool.

(See Bousquet, 1988 for more) The Kytinian appeal is a typical example of the way in which their mythological past was used by Greek poleis in political, economic, social or cultural relations.

Ambassadors or envoys were often on their way from one Greek city to another to carry out diplomatic missions such as these. This is also evident from the various cases in the historical sources which we will be examining in the coming months. But how exactly did such a process work? First of all, the city in need of something sent out an envoy to various city-states. Of course, it had to be decided beforehand which cities were potential candidates and thorough research was done into the mythological relationships that could be called upon. Each allegation also had to be backed up by sufficient evidence. The envoys then left with decrees supporting their mission, presented the case to the city in question in their speeches and, after enjoying the necessary hospitality, moved on to the next one.

The evidence used to prove mythological kinship between different parties also appears to be extremely detailed. If we return for a moment to the story of Kytinion, this becomes very clear. In one part of the epigraphic text we find the following description: The kinship claim does not end here but it gives us a clear indication of how seriously the argument of mythological affiliation must be take, at least in the case of Kytinion. After all, to us it may seem like a strange idea to support an argument with things that one knows for sure did not really happen. In antiquity, however, people seemed to have less of a problem with this. Of course, it does not mean that the ancient Greeks believed these stories and mythological characters really existed.

Initially, diplomacy was used to persuade others. Indeed, a link of kinship was only mentioned when one party wanted to obtain something from another. The idea was that if some kind of relationship was established between the two parties, it would then be much harder to refuse requests for help. A shared past could also make approaching strangers easier, because now there already was a framework in place which this could be done: because of their common ancestry they were no longer strangers to each other. (Erskine, 110) Mythological kinship ties were in some cases also used by cities or individuals to emphasise their Greek identity or their divine character. Alexander the Great, for example, invoked the kinship myth to connect the different peoples in his great empire with himself during his military conquests. After all, it proved to be a good alternative to military conquest.

This guides delves into the Ptolemaic dynasty who ruled over Egypt from the early years after Alexander’s death in 323 BC until the fall of Cleopatra in 31 BC. Distinct aspects of Ptolemaic rule will be looked into as well as specific rulers and their accomplishments. This guide will be expanding as more posts on the Ptolemies will be added to the account, so be sure to check back! Ptolemy I Soter (323‑285 BC) Ptolemy I was one of Alexander’s generals who after his death warred with the other diadiochi over Alexander’s empire. He was the first king and founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty ruling over Egypt from 323 to 285 BC. He grew up at the Macedonian court and became a close adviser of Alexander, supporting him on his claim to the Macedonian throne and serving in important positions during Alexander’s conquests of the East. He fought at Issos in 333 BC and helped Alexander found Alexandria. After Alexander’s death, at first Ptolemy acknowledged the rule of Alexander IV and Philip Arrhidaios but claimed the satrapy of Egypt. He fought with the other successors Lysimachos, Antigonos and Seleucos for control over Alexander’s empire. He clashed with Cleomenes of Naucratis over the rule of Egypt but had him executed in 321 BC. From 306 to 286 BC, Ptolemy expanded his empire by gaining control over Cyrene, Palestine, Cyprus and the Syrian coast. In 286 BC, he extended his influence to include the Cycladic islands and Delos. Ptolemy married three times and had two children with Berenike, Arsinoe II en Ptolemy II, who deified him as Ptolemy Soter after his death in 283 BC. Ptolemy made sure that throughout his empire the administration was solid and founded the city Ptolemais. He wrote a history of Alexander’s life and campaigns which is partly preserved in Arrian’s Anabasis. Silver tetradrachm, Ptolemy I It was minted around 300 BC, during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter (305‑282 BC), most likely in Alexandria. The obverse shows the diademed head of Ptolemy I right, in aegis and a small Δ behind ear. The reverse has the inscription ΠTOΛEMAIOY BAΣIΛEΩΣ surrounding the eagle on a thunderbolt; P and a monogram to the left. This eagle was first adopted by Ptolemy I and soon became a common symbol of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Ptolemaic coins were issued in silver, gold and bronze and used the Phoenician standard which was lighter than the Attic one and used in a lot of other Hellenistic states. During most of the Ptolemaic Kingdom’s history, it was a policy that all foreign coinage within Egypt would be confiscated by the state and replaced with Ptolemaic currency. Parallels between Athens and the Ptolemaic Kingdom can be drawn as Athens attempted to introduce a sole currency in its empire. Ptolemy I and Berenike A gold tetradrachm issued by the Ptolemaic king Ptolemy II Philadelphos. The obverse is shown here depicting Philadelphos’ parents Ptolemy I and Berenike as divine gods, hence the inscription ΘΕΩΝ. The reverse, which is not depicted here shows Ptolemy II Philadelphos with his wife and sister Arsinoe II and the inscription ΑΔΕΛΦΩΝ. This coin was issued to celebrate their partnership and joint rule (276‑270 BC). Ptolemy II Philadelphus (283-246 BC) This gold tetradrachm shows Ptolemy II Philadelphus on the obverse and an eagle surrounded by the inscription ΠΤΟΛΕΑΙΟΥ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ. He ruled over Egypt from 283 to 246 BC. Ptolemy married his sister Arsinoe II, after the banishment of his first wife Arsinoe I, the daughter of Lysimachus. Profiting from the internal weaknesses in the other Hellenistic kingdoms, Ptolemy was able to expand his rule into Syria, Asia Minor an the Aegean. But Ptolemy wasn’t always successful in his military endeavors: he unsuccessfully tried to coax the Greeks against Macedon in the Chremonidean War and he did not fare so well during the Second Syrian War. Yet his diplomatic genius saved him many times. Domestically, Ptolemy II stabilized the Ptolemaic Empire, improving the economy and the administration. Under his rule, agriculture and commerce were further developed and Alexandria served as a main trading and export centre. He built temples and established a ruler‑cult for his parents as well as himself and his sister wife. They were known as the theoi adelphoi, the first example of a Hellenistic ruler cult. He also surrounded himself with famous poets and scientists such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes. He funded the Museum, a research institution which included the famed library of Alexandria. His rule happened at the height Hellenistic civilization and under Ptolemy, the culture and literary influence of the Alexandrian court was at it highest. Coin showing Arsinoe II (316‑270/260 BC) This coin shows Arsinoe II. Arsinoe II was the daughter of Ptolemy I Soter and became the queen of Thrace, Macedon and Anatolia through her marriage to Lysimachus and queen of the Ptolemaic Empire via her marriage with her brother Ptolemy II. She had a big political influence in both of her marriages and was an example for subsequent Ptolemaic queens. She was raised in Alexandria and in 299 BC she married Lysimachos, most likely to solidify an alliance with the king. She had three sons with him and in order to secure the throne for them Arsinoe is said to have turned Lysimachos against him, leading to his execution in 283/3 BC. After his Lysimachos’ death in 281 BC, Arsinoe fled to the city of Cassandreia and married her half‑brother Ptolemy Keraunos. This destastrous marriage was most likely arranged for political reasons and would eventually lead to the death of two of her sons to seek protect protection from her younger brother Ptolemy II. Once there, she married her brother, after possibly having his first wife Arsinoe I exiled. Together with her brother – they were known as the Philadelpoi – Arsinoe actively took part in her brother’s rule. She had her own ruler cult, was a patron of the arts, shared in all of her brother’s titles, had towns dedicated to her, coins were minted in her image and she contributed to political victories. She died at some point between 270 and 260 BC. After her death she was deified by her husband as Arsinoe Philadelphus. Coins showing Berenike II and Arsinoe III Two coins depicting important Ptolemaic women side by side. On the left: an oktodrachm depicting Arsinoe III, the wife of Ptolemy IV, dated to 204‑203 BC. She was the queen between 220 and 204 BC and was the first queen to have children with her own brother. On the coin on the right: Arsinoe’s mother Berenike II who was queen of Egypt between 246 and 222 BC, together with her husband Ptolemy III. Ptolemy III Euergetes (246‑222 BC) A striking portrait of Ptolemy III Euergetes (264‑222 BC) which can be found in the Vatican Museum in Rome. He was the son of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe I. When he became king, he married Berenice of Cyrenaica adding this area to the Ptolemaic kingdom. Just as other Ptolemaic kings, Ptolemy III fought against the Seleucids, in the Third Syrian War (246‑241 BC). He was able to invade their empire and was victorious but was forced to abandon the campaign as a result of an uprising in Egypt. As a result of this, Ptolemy forged a closer bond with the Egyptian priestly elite, which was recorded in the Canopus decree of 238 BC, solidifying the Ptolemaic rule of Egypt. In the Aegean, Ptolemy suffered heavy because his fleet was defeated by the Antigonids at the Battle of Andros in 245 BC. Yet he continued to offer financial support to anti‑Antigonid rulers in mainland Greece for the rest of his reign. Head of Arsinoe III? (246‑204 BC) Head of a Ptolemaic Queen, possibly Arsinoe III (246‑204 BC), the daughter of Ptolemy II and Berenike II. Like many of the Ptolemaic queens, she was married and had children with her own brother Ptolemy IV Philopator. As the queen she was very active in the political scene of the age and is said to have accompanied her husband to the battle of Raphia in 217 BC. In 204 BC she was murdered by her husbands two confidant Sosibius and Agathocles as they feared she would succeed her husband after his death. Ptolemy IV Philopator (222‑205 BC) This golden octodrachm was minted during the reign of Ptolemy IV Philopater and shows the radiated and diademed head of the deified Ptolemy III on the obverse, while the reverse shows the radiated cornucopia bound with royal diadem surrounded by the inscription ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΠΤΟΛΕΜΑΙΟΥ. This cornucopia was also a recurring symbol on Ptolemaic coins. His rule was marked by the Fourth Syrian War (219–217 BC) with the Seleucids which ended in a decisive Ptolemaic victory at the Battle of Raphia, one of the largest battles of the Hellenistic Age. In the last years of his reign, Ptolemy lost control over the southern portion of the country to the rebel Pharaoh Hugronaphor. In 204 BC the king died in mysterious circumstances and was succeeded by his young son Ptolemy V Epiphanes. In ancient sources, Ptolemy was criticized for being more interested in luxury and court ceremony than government, politics, and foreign relations. The decline of the Ptolemaic dynasty is usually traced to his reign. Head of Cleopatra VII (69‑31 BC) This is a buste of Cleopatra VII. The head is made from marble dated to 40‑30 BC and was found along the Via Appia. Cleopatra is shown wearing the traditional broad royal diadem of the Ptolemaic dynasty and her hair is pulled back in the melon hairstyle with bun in the neck. The portrait of the queen was made during her lifetime and most likely set up in an Italian villa. Cleopatra VII Philopater was the daughter of Ptolemy XII and the last pharao and ruler of the Ptolemaic kingdom. Born in 69 BC, Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIII became co‑regent of Egypt after the death of their father in 51 BC. As was the tradition with the Ptolemies, she married her brother and they ruled together. However, they soon turned on one another and Cleopatra was banished. Three years later, Pompey who had lost the civil war to Caesar, fled to Egypt and was murdered by Ptolemy. Taking advantage of Caesar’s anger at this act, Cleopatra used this to gain his support and had her brother killed. In 47 BC, she gave birth to Caesarion, her son with Caesar. Her rule brought stability to the a torn Egypt and she even learned Egyptian. When Caesar died, Cleopatra started a relationship and had three children with Marc Anthony, who married to Octavian’s sister. This caused a tension between the men, which escalated to a full out civil war. Together they ruled over the eastern part of the empire until they were beaten in battle on the coast of Greece where the two armies faced each other. Cleopatra and Marc Anthony fled back to Egypt, but Octavian pursued them and they eventually killed themselves when Alxandria was conquered in 30 BC. What do you think of the Ptolemies?

In 204 BC the king died in mysterious circumstances and was succeeded by his young son Ptolemy V Epiphanes. In ancient sources, Ptolemy was criticized for being more interested in luxury and court ceremony than government, politics, and foreign relations. The decline of the Ptolemaic dynasty is usually traced to his reign. Head of Cleopatra VII (69‑31 BC) This is a buste of Cleopatra VII. The head is made from marble dated to 40‑30 BC and was found along the Via Appia.

Cleopatra VII Philopater was the daughter of Ptolemy XII and the last pharao and ruler of the Ptolemaic kingdom. Born in 69 BC, Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIII became co‑regent of Egypt after the death of their father in 51 BC. As was the tradition with the Ptolemies, she married her brother and they ruled together. However, they soon turned on one another and Cleopatra was banished. Three years later, Pompey who had lost the civil war to Caesar, fled to Egypt and was murdered by Ptolemy. Taking advantage of Caesar’s anger at this act, Cleopatra used this to gain his support and had her brother killed. In 47 BC, she gave birth to Caesarion, her son with Caesar.

Together they ruled over the eastern part of the empire until they were beaten in battle on the coast of Greece where the two armies faced each other. Cleopatra and Marc Anthony fled back to Egypt, but Octavian pursued them and they eventually killed themselves when Alxandria was conquered in 30 BC. What do you think of the Ptolemies?

Even though he died at a very young age, he managed to create one of the biggest empires seen to this day. His conquests of the east were defining for the Hellenistic period as it allowed Greek culture to spread through the non‑Greek world. He has inspired many people and it is no surprise that there are several depictions of Alexander in musea all over the world. So what does this brilliant military leader look like? Are there a lot of differences? Who was allowed to portray him? Read on to find out more! Herm of Alexander the Great, Louvre This herm is easy to identify as Alexander the Great because of the inscription found underneath the head, which reads: “Alexander, (son of) Philip, (king of) Macedon”. Dating first or second century AD, this Herm is a copy of a bronze statue made by the sculptor Lysippos around 330 BC. According to ancient literary sources Alexander only chose a few artists to produce his image, such as the sculptor Lysippos and the painter Apelles. The originals do not survive, but a variety of copies in different materials survive! Head of Alexander, Acropolis Museum It is believed to haven been made between 340 and 330 BC, right in the middle of Alexander’s conquests. The work is most likely an original of the sculptor Leochares, which is interesting because normally official images depicting Alexander were made by the sculptor Lysippos. Head of Alexander, British Museum A bust of Alexander the Great, this one is from the 2nd or 1st century and probably made in Alexandria. During his lifetime, Alexander strictly controlled the ways in which he was depicted. He had only a few sculptors who were allowed make sculptors of him and portrayed him in the typical youthful manner: with clean‑shaven face, long hair and a dynamic turn of the head. Head of Alexander the Great, Glyptoteket This bust of Alexander the Great, found in Alexandria made from marble, dated to 3rd century BC. Alexander was shown without a beard, which was something new: all previous portraits of Greek statesmen or rulers had beards. This fashion lasted for five hundred years and almost all of the Hellenistic kings and Roman emperors until Hadrian were portrayed beardless. Head of Alexander the Great, Istanbul This is the bust of Alexander the Great at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul. Originally the head comes from Pergamon and is dated to the first half of the second century BC. Portraits from before Alexander’s death, his portraits tended to be more mature and realistic, while the posthumous ones show a more youthful, though perhaps more god‑like character. He has longer hair, a more dynamic tilt of the head and an upward gaze, resembling his description in literary sources. Head of Alexander, Louvre This one was made around 300 BC and comes from Cairo and it made from marble and has traces of red colour on the hair and the face. Head of Alexander?, Agora This is head of a young man comes from the second century AD. It is an unfinished copy of an original from the fourth century BC. Experts have identified the individual either as a young Alexander the Great or the god Eubolos, who was connected to the Eleusinian Mysteries Alexander with lion’s skin, Athens He is wearing a lion’s pelt, creating a link with the mythical hero Herakles who wears the lion pelt after he slew the Nemean lion. You can see an image of Heracles with lion skin on the obverse of many of Alexander’s coins. The head was found in the potter’s quarter of Kerameikos in Athens and dates to around 330 BC. The letters carved on Alexander’s cheeks were added at a later date. Alexander coin showing Herakles These marble heads are beautiful, but the most common image of Alexander is featured on his coins. However, the picture most people associate with Alexander is actually the head of Herakles right, wearing lionskin headdress, as seen on this coin. The reverse shows the inscription AΛEXANΔΡOY, Zeus seated left, holding eagle and sceptre. Head of Alexander, tetradrachm of Lysimachos The head of Alexander the Great only shows on coins made by his successors. He always has the horns of Zeus Ammon, which refer to Alexander’s claim to be the son of the Egyptian god Ammon. Silver tetradrachm of Lysimachos The coin shows the diademed head of deified Alexander right, wearing horn of Ammon on the obverse and revers depicts Athena Nikephoros seated left, holding Nike in extended right hand, left arm resting on shield surrounded by the inscription BAΣIΛEΩΣ ΛYΣIMAXOY. Alexander mosaic, house of the Faun A third kind of image of Alexander is the so‑called Alexander mosaicThis mosaic was created around 100 BC and was found in the House of the Faun at Pompeii. The whole mosaic is around 2 meters wide and used more then 1.5 million tesserae. It shows a battle between the armies of Alexander the Great and Darius III, traditionally believed to be the battle of the Issus in 333 BC. The mosaic is thought to be a copy of a Hellenistic painting. It certainly follows the Greek tradition of depicting close up portraits of heroes in battle. Alexander is posed in action while killing a man with his spear. He is wearing a breastplate with Medusa’s head on it and is riding his horse Bulcephalus.

This time we will be exploring Hellenistic Art and some of the most important statues created during the period. We start with what is perhaps thé most famous statue of the Hellenistic period: the Winged Nike of Samothrace. The drama of NIKE Where to begin? It has been on prominent display in the Louvre since 1884 and so the statue has received a lot of attention. One of the few Hellenistic statues that survives in its original form as well as a Roman copy, the winged victory is dated to the second century BC. Because there is no agreement over a more specific date, more precise possibilities for its creation range from 295 to 289 or 200 to 180 BC. The creator of the statue is unknown. It was discovered in 1863 on the island of Samothrace by Charles Champoiseau, the French Vice-Consul of Turkey. The winged goddess of victory was seen on top of the prow of a ship with strong winds blowing through her clothes. The work had been placed into a niche inside a hill overlooking the theatre of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. This sanctuary was dedicated to the Cabeiri, gods who were supposed to protect sailors and seafarers and gain victory in war. The creation of the statue of Nike was most likely commissioned to commemorate a naval battle. The type of ship and the base of the statue indicate that it was created by the Rhodians and perhaps suggesting a battle during the second century BC. HEllenistic Sculpture The Nike of Samothrace is one of the best examples of Hellenistic sculpture (323-31 BC). During this period, art was made for a variety of reasons, appealing to an increasingly diverse audience. A new style of statues moved away from idealized beauty and instead focused on extreme realistic depictions of the every day person and extreme emotions, experimenting even with issues such as disability, gender, drunkenness or old age. Portraits became more naturalistic and statues were also found in theatrical and grandiose compositions such as the Altar of Pergamon. The winged Nike of Samothrace shows this tendency for drama and extreme composition very well as we can see from the angles of the wings, the placement of the leg and flowing of the clothing. The realism of Hellenistic art is evidenced by the wet clothing hanging from the goddess’ naked body. The drama, intense composition and movement as well as the realistic depiction of the goddess clearly explain why this is such a favourite statue among the visitors of the Louvre. Have you seen the Nike of Samotrace in real life? What do you think? Do you like Hellenistic Sculpture? As you might know, I have been working on a colouring book about Ancient Greece.

These silver hemidrachms were minted in two cities that were members of the Achaean League: Megara and Aegira. Read below to find out more about the coins of this Greek federal state! Silver coins of the Achaean Koinon Aside from the civic coinage used by member states, there are two major types of Achaian coins: bronze and silver. Even though they were being made by different cities, these coins have a similar design. On the obverse, the head of Zeus Homarios looking right, while on the reverse a laurel wreath surrounds the monogram AX. Aside from the laurel wreath and monogram, a few letters and small are added on the reverse of the coin from Aegira to identify the city and the magistrate who made the coinage. bronze Achaean coins The bronze coins, generally in worse condition than the silver ones, were produced in one single minting period after 200 BC and depict Zeus Homarios sitting on a throne being offered a wreath by Nike on the obverse and on the reverse a personification of Achaia holding a wreath. Just as with the silver coins, the bronze ones represent both the federal state and the member city because of the presence of both the legend AXAIΩΝ as well as the polis’ ethnicon and the name of the magistrate (in full or abbreviated). Coins and identity In general, coins give us a good idea of how the polis wanted to depict itself to the outside world. They illustrate the presence and the importance of civic identity in Greek poleis during the Hellenistic period as well as before. While we know that individual poleis minted civic coinage throughout Hellenistic times, federal coinage is also accounted for. There is no standard example of what federal coinage looked like as the different nature of these federal states is reflected via their coinage. Coin types from the Aitolian federation, for example, only bear the inscription ΑIΤΩΛΩΝ indicating that the minting of coins was the sole responsibility of the Aetolian federal government. The coins of the Achaian federation tell a different story. The fact that both the polis’ ethnicon and the Achaian monogram appear together on the coins indicate that individual member states could operate within the federal framework with a high degree of autonomy and had a lot of input in the decisions taken by the federal state. Issuing federal coinage seems to have been controlled and planned by the federal state as proven by a comment made by the historian and Megalopolitan Polybius in which he says that: For while many, have attempted in the past to induce the Peloponnesians to adopt a common policy, no one ever succeeding, as each was working not in the cause of general liberty, but for his own aggrandizement, this object has been so much advanced, and so nearly attained, in my own time that not only have they formed an allied and friendly community, but they have the same laws, weights, measures and coinage, as well as the same magistrates, senate, and courts of justice, and the whole Peloponnesus only falls short of being a single city in the fact of its inhabitants not being enclosed by one wall, all other things being, both as regards the whole and as regards each separate town, very nearly identical. (Pol. 2. 37. 11). But the nature of Achaian federal coins also support Polybius’ statement that within the federation all members were equal and could remain relatively autonomous in the organisation of their own civic affairs AND the expression of their own local identity and interests. Obviously, within the Achaean koinon, cities were allowed to express their local as well as their federal identity.

However, he himself did not order the coins to be made. It was in fact one of his successors who had these coins struck: Lysimachos. Read on to discover who he was and why he would do that! The coin itself This is a silver tetradrachm minted during king Lysimachos’ reign between 308 and 281 BC. The obverse shows the youthful head of Alexander the Great looking right, surrounded by a dotted line. You can see the horns of Ammon, which refer to Alexander’s claim to be the son of the Egyptian god Ammon. The reverse shows a seated Athena carrying a small Nike in her right hand and while resting her other hand on her shield. The two deities are surrounded by the inscription ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΛΥΣΙΜΑΧΟΥ (translation: ‘OF KING LYSIMACHOS’). A small Δ can be found underneath the shield possibly indicating the mint in which the coin was made. Who was King Lysimachos? Lysimachos grew up at the Macedonian court in, but is said to have been from a Thessalian family and whose father was a good friend of Philip II. He was one of Alexander’s bodyguards and during their youth is said to have slain a lion after he was locked in a room with it. This event is referenced on some other coins minted by Lysimachos which have his head on one side an a lion on the other. When Alexander unexpectedly died in 323 BC, his kingdom was left without a proper heir. As a result, his empire was eventually divided among his generals after a series of serious conflicts and battles. Lysimachos was appointed as strategos of Thrace and in 306 BC assumed the title of king. Because he won several decisive battles against the other Diadochi, he also became the king of Asia Minor (in 301 BC) and Macedon (from 288 BC) until his death in 281 BC. Why did he put alexander on this coin? He used the image of Alexander for political reasons. By putting the head of Alexander on one side of his coins and his name on the other, Lysimachos created a direct connection between the two and made it clear that he was a legitimate successor of Alexander. Another link between the two can be found via a lion’s paw drawn on the shield of Athena, referring both to Alexander’s Heraklean heritage and Lysimachos’ defeat of the lion. The fact that Alexander appears with his horns of Ammon can also indicate that he was to serve as a divine patron for Lysimachos during his rule. An interesting fact to end with, Lysimachos was not the first of Alexander’s successors to put his face on a coin.

This coin won the numismatic face-off we did on our Instagram account last week, so let us have a closer look at this coin from Hellenistic Athens. Athenian Coins Coins from Athens are among the most easily recognizable of the coins that were made by the ancient Greeks. The Athenian owl is even so iconic that you can still see it on Greek version of the Euro. This design which had the head of Athena on the obverse and the funny-looking owl with an olive branch and the letters Α Θ Ε (short for ΑΘΕΝΑΙΟΝ -“of the Athenians) on the reverse. The choice of the owl and olive branch was not a surprising one they are attributes that have been linked to the goddess Athena. There were around 15 different denominations of these coins: the biggest was a dekadrachm (worth 10 drachms) and the smallest a hemitetartemorion (worth 1/8 of an obol). The coins were used throughout the Mediterranean world, indicating the prominence of Athens among the Greeks. New Athenian Style The Athenians stuck with this design for a very long time: the first coins were minted around 500 BC until well into the Hellenistic period. However, at this time the position of Athens was not the same as it had once been and the production of new coins was very low. By 162, the Romans had begun to focus their attention on the Greek East and Athens produced these new coins as a semi-autonomous city under Roman influence or even rule. From 229 BC onward Athens had enjoyed a good relationship with Rome and when Athens started to mint coins in their own name once more, they opted for a new design: a more stylized version of the famous owl coins. This design was used until 42 BC. The obverse still shows the head of Athena Parthenos, but now she is wearing a helmet with three crests, indicating that she was the goddess of war AND wisdom. A mythological creature can be found on the side of the helmet: maybe Pegasus or a griffin. She is wearing an earring on her ear.

Most people will know the information given to us via the writings of historians such as Herodotos of Halicarnassos, yet there are also the Greek texts such as decrees or funerary steles which tell us more about life in the Greek poleis. Today’s blog post tells us exactly how these texts are studied and interpreted. What is Epigraphy? Examples of Greek pottery fragments with the name of the Athenian that was to be ostracized Epigraphy is the study of texts inscribed, painted and scratched onto hard material such as stone, marble, pottery, wood, metals such as bronze or any other material that is not papyrus. Because of the different material on which these texts were written, they deal with a bunch of different topics. This means that epigraphists can be found working on civic decrees and honours, funerary steles, dedications for gods or benefactors, but also graffitos, ostraka pieces and the names of potter’s left on the pottery. These texts were written for over a thousand years: from around 800 BC until late Antiquity. What do epigraphists do? Primarily since the 18th century epigraphists have studied these texts, sometimes recreating them – often only fragments are found – and registered them in collections such as the IG (Inscriptiones Graecae: this collection aims to collect of the inscriptions of the Greek world) or the CIL (Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum: one of the collections with solely Latin inscriptions). Epigraphists study and draw conclusions from all aspects of these texts: the letters, the material used, the vocabulary and of course the content. For example, by studying the placement of the letters, epigraphists can reconstruct missing pieces from an inscription because a certain amount of letters were put on one line of text. The style of the lettering can also help with the dating of a particular text or even identify the hand that made these letters. Sometimes the texts are difficult to read, because they were badly preserved or damaged over time. An important tool used to make the deciphering of the inscription easier is the squeeze, which is a paper inverse copy of the inscription. Squeezes are made by hammering a wet piece of filter paper on a stone, and leave it to dry. Squeezes are easily transported and durable. It is often preferable to have a squeeze at hand when you want to decipher an inscription and show irregularities that the stone itself any photos can often not show. To see how a squeeze is made, click here. Why are inscriptions important? Inscriptions are among the most important new sources of the ancient world. Every year, new inscriptions are found and published, adding to our knowledge about regions, poleis and areas of life not mentioned by the ancient authors. Inscriptions offer extremely useful information on the social, cultural and religious conditions of the time because they tell us what ordinary Greeks wanted to preserve. This forms a stark contrast to the male aristocratic perspective found in the literary texts. However, the often fragmentary condition and the different types of texts requires considerable background knowledge which often stops historians using epigraphical texts.

This way you can learn more about the beautiful and diverse coins of the Greek world. I have been doing this on the Instagram account, so check out some of the pictures there or use the #NumismaticThursdays. The Silver Coin hoard from Myrina The very first coin of the week is a silver stater from the island polis of Aegina. It was found as part of a coin hoard in the Greek city of Myrina in 1970. The hoard was probably buried around 440 BC and consisted of 149 of these Aeginetan silver staters. All of which were collected in a black-glaze olpe. An olpe was normally used to drink wine from, but here the owner used it to bury his coins. A silver stater from Aegina The island polis of Aegina was the first Greek polis to strike their own coinage as the earliest coins from the city were struck not long after 650 BC. Due to their extensive sea trade with the rest of the Mediterranean and outside, the city realized pretty early on that adopting the monetary system was far better than other systems of bartering. The coins from Aegina are easily recognizable due to the presence of the turtle (sea as well as land) on the obverse of the coin. These remained the main symbol on Aeginetan coinage throughout their history. The stamps on the reverse have changed: while on this coin you can see an incused cross, there are other examples of an incused square which divided the coin in five or an incused square with a dolphin, etc. The fact that the sea trading polis chose to depict a turtle on their coinage is not a coincidence. As well as being a sea trading community, the turtles were chosen because Aegina traded silver before they used coins and the early silver ingots had a shape that looked like the shells of the turtles. Aegrinatan weigth standard Throughout the Greek World there were different weight standards and measurements, including the Aeginetan one which was one of two that was used all over Greece. This weight standard included a didrachm or stater weighing 12.2 grams, a drachma 6.1 grams, a hemidrachm or triobol of about three grams and an obol that was one gram. The silver staters have been found most frequently, for example in hoards such as the one our coin is from. These coins can sometimes be heavily worn from circulation or slashed with test cuts or banker’s marks which were small punches on a coin that validated it as good on a local market.

Due to their extensive sea trade with the rest of the Mediterranean and outside, the city realized pretty early on that adopting the monetary system was far better than other systems of bartering. The coins from Aegina are easily recognizable due to the presence of the turtle (sea as well as land) on the obverse of the coin. These remained the main symbol on Aeginetan coinage throughout their history. The stamps on the reverse have changed: while on this coin you can see an incused cross, there are other examples of an incused square which divided the coin in five or an incused square with a dolphin, etc. The fact that the sea trading polis chose to depict a turtle on their coinage is not a coincidence.

Aegrinatan weigth standard Throughout the Greek World there were different weight standards and measurements, including the Aeginetan one which was one of two that was used all over Greece. This weight standard included a didrachm or stater weighing 12.2 grams, a drachma 6.1 grams, a hemidrachm or triobol of about three grams and an obol that was one gram. The silver staters have been found most frequently, for example in hoards such as the one our coin is from. These coins can sometimes be heavily worn from circulation or slashed with test cuts or banker’s marks which were small punches on a coin that validated it as good on a local market.

Together with Aratus of Sikyon, he has to be seen as one of the most famous statesmen of the Achaian League. Here I am, happy to see this statue of Philopoemen made in 1830 by David D’angers. Ῥωμαίων δέ τις ἐπαινῶν ἔσχατον αὐτὸν Ἑλλήνων προσεῖπεν, ὡς οὐδένα μέγαν μετὰ τοῦτον ἔτι τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἄνδρα γειναμένης οὐδὲ αὑτῆς ἄξιον. And a certain Roman, in praising him, called him the last of the Greeks, implying that Greece produced no great man after him, nor one worthy of her. Youth Philopoemen was born in 253 B.C. in Megalopolis. His father Creugas, who was originally from Mantinea but was banished, died when Philopoemen was rather young. As a result, he was taken in by Cleander, a prominent Megalopolitan. His education was entrusted to two local philosophers, Ecdemus and Demophanes. Both men had been involved in overthrowing the former tyrant of Megalopolis and instilled in Philopoemen a life-long passion and desire for democracy and patriotism. Military career Philopoemen first came to prominence in 223 B.C. when he organised a mass evacuation of the Megalopolitans during a Spartan siege of the city by king Kleomenes III. Under this king’s rule, Sparta had known an increase in power and prominence which was unprecedented during the Hellenistic period. Consequently, Kleomenes wanted to conquer those areas close to Sparta which were members of the Achaian Koinon. After the king had occupied the Megalopolitan Agora, Philopoemen convinced his fellow citizens – now finding refuge in neighbouring Messene – not to accept the truce offered as it was sure to be a trick. Together with the other members of the Achaian Koinon and the Macedonian king Antigonos III Doson, Megalopolis fought a war against Kleomenes III (229-222 B.C.). Philopoemen stands out again in the historical records as Plutarch tells us that he deliberately ignored orders by leading a cavalry attack when he saw his allies were in danger. But he did not stop there, he continued to fight on foot, even after a spear pierced both of his thighs (Plut. Phil. 6. 3.) This episode formed the starting point of Philopoemen’s exceptional career and reputation, which was characterized by a vehement opposition to Sparta and desire for Achaian independence and patriotism. Leader of the Achaian Koinon After a few years spent as a general in Crete, Philopoemen returned to the Peloponnese in 210 B.C. to find the Achaian Koinon at war with Rome and the Aetolian Koinon, a former ally, on account of their alliance with Philip V of Macedon (First Macedonian War 217-205 B.C.). Philopoemen won a few more military successes, but the Achaian army was in an abysmal state and needed an urgent reform. Particularly because there was another tyrant in power, Machanides, who wanted to continue Kleomenes’ plan to conquer the areas around Sparta. In 207 B.C., both parties met at Mantinea and Philopoemen succeeded in killing the Spartan. Over the next few years, Philopoemen’s reputation grew and he was elected strategos of the Koinon multiple times. Apparently, his fame was so great that Philip V had attempted to assasinate him after the League had chosen the switch sides and become a Roman ally during the Second Macedonian War (200-196 B.C.) (Plut. Phil. 12. 3.). While the Rome become more active in the Greek East, Sparta continued to trouble Megalopolis and the Koinon as well, this time under a new ruler, Nabis. Even though Philopoemen had defeated him in 199 B.C., the Spartan ruler could regroup and start another war in 194 B.C. He was once again defeated by Philopoemen but he managed to save his skin through an alliance with Rome in the war against Antiochus III (192-188 B.C.). He betrayed this alliance in 192 B.C. by going to Aetolians for help, he was murdered however and Philopoemen finally managed to use the confusion – the ongoing war with Antiochus III and the murder of Nabis led to an Aetolian occupation of Sparta – to join the polis with the Achaean Koinon once and for all. In 188 B.C., he tore down the Spartan city walls and used the funds to create the Philippeion in Megalopolis. Death During next few years, the Achaian relationship with Rome started to deteriorate as Rome became more and more involved in local politics. Especially the koinon’s relationship with Sparta and the way this was handled by Philopoemen was a straining point. Whenever Spartan envoys were sent to Rome, Philopoemen would defend his actions and make it clear that the Romans had nothing to say about the internal Achaean affairs. However, Sparta was not the only member of the polis that rebelled against the League. In 183 B.C., Messene revolted and Philopoemen, who was already old and sick, decided to go to battle again. He was thrown of his horse and captured, after which he was beaten and thrown into the thesaurus where he was forced to drink poison. The Megalopolitans and Achaeans were devastated and defeated the city, after which it became an Achaian member once more and Philopoemen’s body was transported back to Megalopolis and buried there. After Rome’s conquest of Greece in 146 B.C., Philopoemen’s grave would have been destroyed if Polybius had not prevented it (Pol. Hist. 39. 14.).

His Histories not only provide us with a plethora of information on ‘Rome’s rise to power’, but the wider political reality of the Hellenistic World of the third and second centuries BC. Our series on the ‘great’ Hellenistic figures is off to a great start! ἐπεὶ δ᾽ οὐ τινὲς οὐδ᾽ ἐπὶ ποσόν, ἀλλὰ πάντες ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν ἀρχῇ καὶ τέλει κέχρηνται τούτῳ, φάσκοντες ἀληθινωτάτην μὲν εἶναι παιδείαν καὶ γυμνασίαν πρὸς τὰς πολιτικὰς πράξεις τὴν ἐκ τῆς ἱστορίας μάθησιν. But all historians, one may say without exception, and in no half-hearted manner, but making this the beginning and end of their labour, have impressed on us that the soundest education and training for political actions is the study of History. LIFE Born around 200 BC, Polybius was part of an aristocratic Megalopolitan family. His father Lykortas had a prominent career in the Achaean Koinon, a federal state which united a large number of poleis on the Greek mainland. Not much is known about Polybius’ youth, but he appears to have developed a keen interest in politics as he fought as part of the cavalry in the battle against Messene in 183 BC at the age of 17. Coincidentally, this was also the battle in which the famous Achaean statesman Philopoemen died. As his father was a good friend of the general, Polybius was chosen to carry his ashes back to their native city (Plut. Phil. 21.). By the time Polybius was in his thirties, his political star had continued to rise: among other things he accompanied his father on a foreign diplomatic mission to Alexandria. By the time he was thirty in 170 BC, Polybius had been elected commander of the cavalry for the tenth time. However, the Third Macedonian War (171-168 BC) brought the renewed tensions between Macedonian Kingdom and Rome to the Greek states. The Roman victory not only established the end of the Macedonian kingdom but it also had a profound impact on internal Achaean affairs: a thousand of the most influential Achaean leaders, including Polybius, were shipped off to Rome. This because of Roman concerns that the Achaeans had not justly supported their cause. The man responsible, according to Polybius at least, was Kallikrates of Leontium as he had used this opportunity to carve out a position of power for himself (Pol. His. 30. 29.). Doomed to spend the next 17 years in exile in Rome, Polybius became acquainted with Scipio Aemilianus, the son of the Roman general Aemilius Paulus who had defeated the Macedonian king Perseus at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC. When Scipio’s military career took him abroad on expeditions to Spain and Africa, Polybius would accompany his good friend. Even after the Achaeans were allowed to return home in 150 BC, he continued to accompany Scipio on his foreign expeditions: he was there for example, when the city of Carthage was destroyed in 146 BC. At the same time the Achaen Koinon was embroiled in a war with Rome. Polybius only returned after the destruction of Corinth to help rebuild the Achaean state and Greece as a whole. He remained in Achaea until his death around 118 BC. WORK During his exile in Rome, Polybius had direct access to the inner workings of the Roman state. Due to his interest in politics and history, which were undoubtedly Polybius decided to write a history to discover how the Romans came to conquer a big part of the known world in only 53 years (229-168 BC), eventually expanding his work until 146 BC. Polybius’ Histories are an invaluable source for anyone working on Roman history of the second century BC, as well as the wider Hellenistic World as he pays considerable attention to other parts of the Hellenistic World throughout his narrative, providing us with information not found in other authors. Aside from the Histories, Polybius also wrote a biography for his great hero Philipoemen and a military treatise Tactics, which has not survived.

There are plenty of blogs out there to help you guide you along the way. One of the most helpful blogs is by far Pubs and Publications. It was started back in 2015 by several history PhD’s at the University of Edinburgh with the sole aim of helping people getting through their PhD by providing helpful posts about a variety of themes connected to the PhD journey. Five years on, there have been so many useful posts published, such as one on heartbreak, another on the writing of an opinion piece, or this beautiful one on the issues of writing about ancient history. Even if you are not remotely interested in doing a PhD, it is worth having a look at! For more information, check out this piece I wrote a few years ago about my love for Polybius. The original text, and much more can be found here. Love, Marry, Kill: the Polybius edition. As an ancient historian, one of the questions I get asked most often is: ‘So if you’re working on something that happened over 2000 years ago, what sources are you using?’. The answer is that, thankfully, classicists have quite a few different types of sources to work with from ancient authors to inscriptions, coins to papyri and even archaeological evidence. In most cases your research will force you to combine several of these different kind of sources, mostly because a lot of the evidence that previously existed has been lost due to the passing of time, choices made by those copying down the text for posterity and the destruction of places/archaeological sites. This lack of source material is one of things that has caused many scholars – and I’m sure this is applicable to anyone working with sources – to utter a few choice words in frustration after discovering that that one book/volume dealing with the topic of your research has simply disappeared. This notwithstanding, a lack of sources does not mean there is nothing (new) to say about Ancient Greece or Rome. Moreover, I would say that it forces us to be more creative in doing our research and immerse ourselves more in the sources, applying new methods of interpretation or visiting archaeological sites that are connected to one’s research in order to gain a fresh perspective. It can be quite problematic however to have to deal with one source which dominates your research. In my case, I’m dealing with Polybius an ancient Greek author who lived in the second century B.C. Born in the city of Megalopolis, he seemed to be destined for a promising career in the Achaean Koinon, a powerful Greek federal state in the Hellenistic period, until he was banished to Rome in 168 B.C. Whilst living in Rome he wrote his Histories, a work consisting of 40 books/volumes about the Roman conquest of the Mediterranean. As my PhD thesis deals with both Megalopolis and the Achaean Koinon, I have spent countless hours perusing the works of this Greek guy and somehow over all of those hours I have come to both love and hate Polybius. Firstly, I am extremely happy that his work is, for the most part, still around and that it contains all of the information that I need to be able to do my research. Though it is extremely challenging to have to wade through his extensive work, which incidentally has been relied upon very heavily by other authors, and try to figure out when Polybius is talking about someone he clearly does not like, if this person really was that bad or as influential as he paints him out to be. Trying to objectively work out certain events, is even trickier as his work like any historian is always subjective to a certain degree. On the other hand, it can be extremely amusing to find political theories or little and very subjective passages in which you can clearly see that the author does not like the person, event or even a group of people he describes. It makes both research and reading just that little bit more entertaining, and allows my mind to ponder about the kind of person I imagine Polybius would have been. In a way I think Polybius has become some sort of distant friend I have made by reading his work so thoroughly over the course of the past two years. It has allowed me to make statements like ‘Polybius would have hated this guy, because he was not from a political elite.’ or ‘That is not how Polybius sees the ideal ladder.’ I guess what I’m trying to say is that for an ancient historian like me who is working with a single source a lot of the time, it can be tricky trying to navigate having this one particular source. While it becomes annoying to constantly having to disregard information because you cannot know how reliable/objective it is, it is ultimately nothing when compared to the actual value of the wealth of material you can gain from an in-depth analysis of one source. As for Polybius: sometimes I feel like I could travel back in time and kill him, but overall I think it must be love.

In most cases your research will force you to combine several of these different kind of sources, mostly because a lot of the evidence that previously existed has been lost due to the passing of time, choices made by those copying down the text for posterity and the destruction of places/archaeological sites. This lack of source material is one of things that has caused many scholars – and I’m sure this is applicable to anyone working with sources – to utter a few choice words in frustration after discovering that that one book/volume dealing with the topic of your research has simply disappeared.

As some of may know, I have an avid interest in numismatics and this new tool allows you to browse a database with the data of 2,387 hoards of coins in the Mediterranean between ca. 650 and 30 BC. When using the database, you will see an entry with a basic description, hoard mapping tools for the findspot and mint(s) where the coins found in the hoard were produced, bibliographical references, and a list of the hoard contents. Even though it is a very new tool, it has a lot of potential. TOPOSTEXT ToposText is another digital tool that I have found invaluable when doing my own research. While it is another online collection of ancient texts like Perseus, the beauty of this tool is that it allows you to browse a map of Greece or a list. Upon selecting a specific city or site, a table of two-line snippets from ancient authors pops up as well as an index list, which can be filtered by date, genre, and relevance.

Due to the vast majority of Greek vases that survived from antiquity, they have taught us a lot about life in the ancient world. If you have examined one of these bowls or amphorae, you might have noticed the different styles used to decorate them. In this post, we delve a little deeper into the different decorative styles of ancient Greek pottery. PROTO-GEOMETRIC POTTERY The first distinct Greek pottery style was the so-called Proto-Geometric style which emerged in Greece around 1000 BC. The pottery produced at this stage had simple designs which heavily featured circles, semi-circles or simple black lines. Sometimes, whole parts of the vase would be painted completely black. GEOMETRIC POttERY From 900 BC, Geometric designs were painted on the central part of the vase, often wedged in between two completely black sections. Geometric pottery had bold linear patterns and lines and from 800 BC these designs also included stylize human figures, birds and animals. All of these patterns were painted on the vases in brown or black paint. In the 7th century, the Orientalising style appeared in Corinth due to the polis’ trade with the east. Typical for the Orientalising style are stylized plants, animals and curved lines. The stylized human figures painted in black became more and more pronounced, resulting in the black figure style. Black figure Pottery From the middle of the eight century, the black-figure technique became more and more common. Originating in Corinth, and later Athens, the black-figure technique was embodied by silhouetted dark figures enlivened with incisions and patches of colourful clay. These figures were created by implemented figures and floral motives with a slip that turned black during firing while the background remained red throughout the process. The figures were further detailed by incising the slip or by using white or purple paint to apply additional details. The painters depicted a variety of flora, fauna, myths, legends and daily life. The black figure pottery style remained dominant until 520 BC, when painters in Athens started experiencing with the red-figure technique. Red figure Pottery The red-figure style, which originated in Athens in the second half of the sixth century. This new technique enabled painters to represent figures in three-quarter view and led to further experiments over the next century in foreshortening, perspective and shading. At the end of the sixth century, artists competed to represent the human form. Red-figure styles in the western Greek colonies, especially in South Italy, were adapted to suit local tastes but but also evidence a continuing enthusiasm for Greek drama and religion. White ground Pottery The final post in the series on Greek pottery is about white ground pottery. This technique was, once again, developed in Attica around 500 BC. A layer of white slip of kaolinite covered the vase in order to make it more appear more valuable. The style was also used in proto-geometric pottery in the Cyclades among others. The white-figure painting was less durable than red or black figure painting, making it especially suited for votive or funerary purposes and the technique became particularly connected to lekythoi – vessels used to store oil in.

These can include some very unusual objects such as cowry shells, cocoa beans and even cows or buck skins as they were used as forms of payment before the usage of these little pieces of paper and metal. In this post, we will however solely be focusing on Greek numismatics – and thus the study of ancient coins. The find of a coin is always an interesting find as it can help identify the dating of a specific archaeological layer as well as give information on trade, economy, ideology, mythology and many other fields. According to the Greeks, the earliest known example of ancient coins were made from electron and could be found in Lydia during the 6th century BC. These were just simple lumps of metal that were stamped to ensure the value of these coins, the stamp meant that they were guaranteed a certain weight in silver, gold or electron (which actually was a mixture between gold and silver). A silver stater from Aegina, dated between 480 and 457 BC. The first real Greek coins were made from silver and came from Aegina around 600 BC. These coins had a seaturtle minted on them to show the connection of the island polis with the sea and the prosperity it gave them. Soon other poleis’ followed Aegina’s lead and all over Greece city-states minted coinage, primarily as they needed a way to pay mercenary soldiers. These soldiers traveled around a lot and the fact that cities started minting their own coinage with specific designs tied to the history of their cities made that a lot easier. Moreover, the minting of these coins was also another way of showing civic pride or prestige and could lead to more influential imposing their coinage on neighboring cities. During the Hellenistic times, ruler – following the example of Alexander the Great – minted coinage with own image and spread it throughout their empire as well as federal states issuing coinage to show their federal identity. Parts of the coin Obverse: This flat side of the coin is sometimes also referred to as heads because it bears the principle design of the coin on it. Greek poleis such as Athens and Klazomenai chose to depict a symbol of the city’s patron deity or their heads, as you can see in the obverses in the picture. Other poleis like Aigina went with a symbol was linked to their city, such as the turtle. Throughout most of the archaic and classical period, the choice of these symbols and designs remained consistent. The coinage of Alexander the Great and subsequent Hellenistic kings introduced the tradition that on the head of the ruler was depicted under whose rule the coins were minted. This is the reason why this side of a coin is also known as heads. Reverse: This is mostly seen as the side of the coin that was hit by the hammer when the coin was minted. Coins we made by designing two dies with a pattern and placing a piece of metal in between and hitting it with a hammer. Traditionally, the reverse was easily recognizable because in early coins, the reverse die would have a simple design or a incused pattern as can. Over time, these designs could become much more complicated and intrinsic and sometimes even allude to current events or show real statues of deities. The minting of the coins Coins in Greece were primarily silver, but sometimes gold and bronze coins are also found. The metal was molten down and poured into a premade mould or sliced into circles of the right weight and size. Next, two engraved dies would be used to mint the desired design onto the coin by putting the flan (the blank coin) between these two dies. Normally, the obverse die was set into an anvil and the minter would then place the reverse die on the flan and hit it with a hammer. Designs on the coins The designs of the coins differ from city to city, ruler to ruler and koinon to konon. Many of the currency of these poleis showed specific elements connected to the mythological past of the city and over time became sources of instant recognition for the polis. For example, everyone seeing the coin with face of Athena and the famous owls on it, will know that this coin was minted in Athens. Likewise, the imagery of Alexander the Great and the face of Heracles was used for centuries after his death by the diadochoi in order to associate themselves with their great example. Coin Hoards Picture of a coin hoard from the Achaean Koinon. Coins were often secretly buried to ensure their safety from robbers and other criminal. This is one of the reasons why so many coins are found together in so-called coin hoards. It allows numismatist to track changes in the coins with a similar design struck in the same mint and is a key element in so-called die studies. Where the coins are lined up in such a way that scholars can deduce when a new die was used in the minting of the coins. Naturally coins also found outside of these hoards, often a lone coin is found during the excavation of an archaeological site, construction works of through a metal detector. The picture shows a coin hoard with silver federal coinage from the Achaian Koinon, a Hellenistic federal state. It has both Achaian federal coinage as civic Greek coinage, illustrating that many different coin types can be part of a coin hoard.","tokens":1122,"chunks":[{"article_title":"Numismatics","article_url":"https://www.hellenistichistory.com/2020/04/15/numismatics/","article_date":"2021-02-08T21:56:28+00:00","content":"Numismatics is the study and collection of currency, including coins, paper money, and other things related items.

Soon other poleis’ followed Aegina’s lead and all over Greece city-states minted coinage, primarily as they needed a way to pay mercenary soldiers. These soldiers traveled around a lot and the fact that cities started minting their own coinage with specific designs tied to the history of their cities made that a lot easier.

During the Hellenistic times, ruler – following the example of Alexander the Great – minted coinage with own image and spread it throughout their empire as well as federal states issuing coinage to show their federal identity. Parts of the coin Obverse: This flat side of the coin is sometimes also referred to as heads because it bears the principle design of the coin on it. Greek poleis such as Athens and Klazomenai chose to depict a symbol of the city’s patron deity or their heads, as you can see in the obverses in the picture. Other poleis like Aigina went with a symbol was linked to their city, such as the turtle. Throughout most of the archaic and classical period, the choice of these symbols and designs remained consistent.

This is the reason why this side of a coin is also known as heads. Reverse: This is mostly seen as the side of the coin that was hit by the hammer when the coin was minted. Coins we made by designing two dies with a pattern and placing a piece of metal in between and hitting it with a hammer. Traditionally, the reverse was easily recognizable because in early coins, the reverse die would have a simple design or a incused pattern as can. Over time, these designs could become much more complicated and intrinsic and sometimes even allude to current events or show real statues of deities. The minting of the coins Coins in Greece were primarily silver, but sometimes gold and bronze coins are also found.

Next, two engraved dies would be used to mint the desired design onto the coin by putting the flan (the blank coin) between these two dies. Normally, the obverse die was set into an anvil and the minter would then place the reverse die on the flan and hit it with a hammer. Designs on the coins The designs of the coins differ from city to city, ruler to ruler and koinon to konon. Many of the currency of these poleis showed specific elements connected to the mythological past of the city and over time became sources of instant recognition for the polis. For example, everyone seeing the coin with face of Athena and the famous owls on it, will know that this coin was minted in Athens.

Coin Hoards Picture of a coin hoard from the Achaean Koinon. Coins were often secretly buried to ensure their safety from robbers and other criminal. This is one of the reasons why so many coins are found together in so-called coin hoards. It allows numismatist to track changes in the coins with a similar design struck in the same mint and is a key element in so-called die studies. Where the coins are lined up in such a way that scholars can deduce when a new die was used in the minting of the coins. Naturally coins also found outside of these hoards, often a lone coin is found during the excavation of an archaeological site, construction works of through a metal detector.  The picture shows a coin hoard with silver federal coinage from the Achaian Koinon, a Hellenistic federal state. It has both Achaian federal coinage as civic Greek coinage, illustrating that many different coin types can be part of a coin hoard.","content_tokens":241,"embedding":[]}]}]}
